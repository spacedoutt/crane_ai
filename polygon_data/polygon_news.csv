Surprise! Fortnite is getting a new map and mode on Saturday,"Itâs time to return to Tilted Towers. Fortnite is getting a surprise update this weekend. Itâs called âReloadâ and itâll launch on Saturday, the official Fortnite account said on X. A teaser trailer revealed it this update will introduce a new map and mode to Fortnite. 
You can view the full teaser on the official Fortnite X account. Longer-time players might recognize the map has classic locations from previous versions of the game like Tilted Towers, Retail Row, and more. Other than that, we donât have a lot of details on the update. However, the map looks a bit smaller than your average Fortnite map, so players will have to see how that will impact this new way to play.

Fortnite is currently in Chapter 5 Season 3. The current version of the game, called âWrecked,â has players duke it out in a desert wasteland inspired by Fallout and features the metal band Metallica. At the moment, the game is going full Mad Max and allows players to fight with a variety of tricked out war vehicles and more. Itâs a rather chaotic way to play and has inspired criticism from players. Now, itâs looking like fans will be able to try their hand at a new play mode.

League of Legendsâ new summer event includes a survivor-style game mode,"League of Legendsâ summer event is always a highlight for the year. In past years, weâve seen visual novels and deep dives into alternate universes like Soul Fighter, Spirit Blossom, or Star Guardian. This year, the Anima Squad skin line gets the spotlight, along with a new survivor-style bullet heaven game that can be played co-op or solo.
Anima Squad debuted in 2022, and depicts League champions as cybernetic, animal-themed warriors defending humanity. This year, weâre getting new crew members like Battle Bunny Aurora, the new championâs debut skin; Battle Bear Illaoi; and Cyber Cat Yuumi. 
In the lore of Anima Squad, humanity has been pushed back to a few bastions. Primordials, the white blood cells of Earth, have become hostile to humanity. These kaiju-like creatures are swarming out of the oceans, and only a few heroes wearing repurposed Primordial technology can protect what remains.
The new game mode is called Swarm, or Operation: Anima Squad. Players can queue up solo, or play with up to three friends. This game mode plays very differently than standard League of Legends; itâs much closer to Vampire Survivors with a WASD control scheme. The player must survive a showdown in Final City, mowing down waves of Primordials. Every match gives rewards that lead to greater power over time, so even a failed match can pay off down the road and eventually help you survive longer, kill more Primordials, and earn more rewards.
Weâre also getting a huge list of new skins: Seraphine, Yuumi, Leona, Xayah, Illaoi, Aurora, and Yasuo join Anima Squad while Briar, RekâSai, and BelâVeth play the antagonistic Primordials (although Briar defects to join the good guys, making her a bit of both). This year, the summer event runs from July 17 to Aug. 19. As with past game modes, itâs possible that Swarm could return to League of Legends in the future â weâll have to wait and see what Riot thinks of player reception to Operation: Anima Squad first.

Dune: Awakeningâs alternate history setup sounds fascinating,"Itâs not easy to adapt a fictional property â The Lord of the Rings, say, or the DC Universe âinto a massively multiplayer online game, or any kind of living game. Many have failed. The demands of a set canon are seldom compatible with an evolving online world, or a universe in which thousands of players are living their own heroâs journeys.
Funcom knows this: The Norwegian developer has been making MMOs since 2001âs Anarchy Online, including a licensed effort, Age of Conan. So, for survival MMO Dune: Awakening, Funcom, Frank Herbertâs estate, and Legendary (producers of the Dune movies) decided to do something very smart: change the Dune timeline and establish its own alternate history of Arrakis.
As teased in the gameâs Summer Game Fest trailer and detailed in a new half-hour deep dive video, in Dune: Awakeningâs setting, Paul Atreides was never born. His mother, Lady Jessica, chose to have a daughter instead of a son, tying her more closely to the Bene Gesserit; Jessica is trained as a truthsayer and foretells Doctor Yuehâs betrayal, so her husband, Duke Leto, survives and House Atreides isnât wiped out in the attack on Arrakeen.
With Paul out of the picture, thereâs a power vacuum, and more narrative room for players to feel like the heroes of their own stories. And House Atreides and House Harkonnen are evenly matched in a war for the future of Arrakis â a convenient setup for the factional gameplay that MMOs thrive on. But the essential political motivations of all the characters and players remain the same as in Frank Herbertâs original vision.
The Fremen are the final piece of this puzzle, and Funcom has chosen to put them at the center of a narrative mystery. The desert inhabitants of Arrakis have disappeared â supposedly wiped out, according to Imperium propaganda. What happened to them? Where did they go? Players are sent in search of the missing people, exploring their abandoned dwellings, rites, culture, and spirituality as they go. (Iâd say the chances of the Fremen being added as a playable faction later on, perhaps in an expansion, seem pretty high.)
In terms of gameplay, the video is a little lighter on detail, but there are some interesting tidbits. A look at the character creator reveals that a choice of mentor determines your characterâs starting ability: Choose a Mentat mentor and youâll be able to scan enemies and objects for information; a Bene Gesserit mentor will teach you to use the Voice to compel characters to approach you (effectively a taunt); a Swordmaster background grants you a defensive stance. But youâll be able to combine abilities from the different schools later in the game.
In a section of the video focused on the gameâs closed beta and its online structure, creative director Joel Bylos said that Dune: Awakeningâs endgame lies in an area called the Deep Desert. There, hundreds of concurrent players will engage in player-versus-player combat, harvest spice in big groups, and engage with an endgame political system.
Bylos also explained what makes the game an MMO. As opposed to a single-server, single-map game like Ark: Survival Evolved, Dune: Awakening will group multiple maps and servers together into âworldsâ of thousands of players who can organize themselves into guilds. The starting area, Hagga Basin, supports a minimum of 40 players per server, but beyond that there are social hubs and the Deep Desert, where Bylos promised âmany, many hundredsâ of players will be able to play together. The Overland map is its own live server that links these locations, with players using Ornithopters and other transportation to move around it in real time.
Dune: Awakening has no announced release date, but itâs coming to PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. Funcom says it will show live gameplay at Gamescom, which runs from Aug. 21-25. ",https://www.polygon.com/24183043/dune-awakening-direct-story-gameplay-june-2024,2024-06-21 15:38:14
Every Blu-ray should come with Kingdom of the Planet of the Apesâ best special feature,"Itâs no secret that Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a visual-effects-heavy movie. After all, there are only two human characters, and every other speaking part in the movie belongs to a CGI ape. But just because there are a lot of digital characters doesnât mean the actors portraying them werenât giving full performances. In fact, most of the characters were fully motion-captured, and the movieâs 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray is here to prove it. 
The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes 4K set includes a special version of the movie, dubbed The Raw Cut, thatâs a split-screen version of the entire movie â one side is the finished film and the other is stripped of all the filmâs visual effects. In other words, itâs just the actors in their mocap suits acting out the scenes as their ape characters. (The Raw Cut is not included in the Blu-ray or DVD releases of the movie â just the 4K Blu-ray.) 
On the one hand, this is probably a very awkward way to watch the movie in which youâre constantly confronted with the fact that the whole thing is just a bunch of people pretending to be monkeys. On the other hand, The Raw Cut is an excellent way to show off just how much work the actors are doing and how incredible their full-body performances are. 
Showcasing the work of motion capture actors has never really been easy. First popularized with Andy Serkisâ performance as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers in 2002, unfinished footage of actors performing in mocap suits has provided insight into just how complicated the process is and how intricate the physical performance can be. But this Kingdom special feature shows one way filmmakers can show off just how incredible their filmsâ performers are, which is why it should become standard for every visual effects-heavy movie. 
The 4K UHD Blu-ray version of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is set to be released on Aug. 27. The Raw Cut will also include an optional commentary track featuring director Wes Ball, editor Dan Zimmerman, and VFX supervisor Erik Winquist.

"The highly anticipated Altered TCG introduces The Sandman, a tribute to Neil Gaiman","Altered is the new trading card game from startup Equinox Studio that earned nearly $7 million on Kickstarter earlier this year. With distribution being handled globally by board and card game giant Asmodee, the French-made TCG is ready to go head-to-head against Magic: The Gathering, Disney Lorcana, Flesh & Blood, and Star Wars: Unlimited with a bevy of unique features. Now, in advance of the United Statesâ retail release on Sept. 13, weâre getting our first look at the gameâs fantastical factions.
Today Polygon can exclusively reveal The Sandman, a powerful character from the gameâs Lyra faction.
In Altered, players explore a fanciful post-apocalyptic setting where the world outside the city of Asgartha has been completely transformed. Itâs up to players to conduct successful expeditions, becoming the first player at the table to reunite their deckâs main character and a lovable sidekick. 
âItâs a chaotic place with lots of volatile ideas,â said Altered narrative designer Yoshi Mimura. âThe [player character] is an Alterer, [and] the power of the Alterer is to shape the world around them so that they can stabilize the regions where they meet to help [make] the world a more sustainable and livable place.â
Itâs a game about creation, not destruction, and Mimura says that The Sandman has an important role to play.
âLyra tend to focus on imagination, and stories, and legends, and everything that is transmitted orally,â Mimura said. âThe Sandman is kind of a creator of worlds, and a person who can shape dreams. They can inspire people, and by doing so we can try to make the world a better place. Itâs also a character that is profoundly linked to a personal hero of mine, Neil Gaiman.â
When players pull cards from a blind pack in Altered, they have the chance to pull either the common of the more rare versions of The Sandman. The rare version above, which retains its Lyra faction allegiance, costs one less to play from a playerâs reserve and allows for a boost of two to be optionally placed on top of it. That makes it cheaper to play, and more powerful in the field. 
Both versions of the card also allow a player to apply a status, called Asleep, to another Character on the table. According to one of the gameâs designers, FranÃ§ois Jourdain, the Asleep status can be used either defensively or offensively. The easiest way to use it would be to put an opponentâs character to sleep, removing them from the ensuing conflict and allowing you to make progress against your opponent. But you can also use it on your own characters: Asleep can prevent them from participating in a combat they are sure to lose, or players can proactively place characters asleep in order to bring them forward in following rounds more cheaply or alongside more powerful allies. Itâs a debuff, a feint, and an attack strategy all in one.
A third, even more rare version of the card applies those same powers but to a different faction. This one, called Ordis, opens up even more and different strategic possibilities. Mimura was quick to add that other versions of The Sandman will likely surface in the future.
âWhen you materialize a character from imagination,â Mimura said, âyou can feed it with your own vision of what the character is. [...] So maybe in the future [...] he will have a completely different face, or maybe it will be women. We try to have all the options open to showcase a lot of diversity.â ",https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24182616/altered-tcg-card-preview-sandman-lyra-ordis,2024-06-21 14:04:30
"Beyond Good & Evil 4K remaster is finally official, out next week","The original Beyond Good & Evil is getting a 4K overhaul for its 20th anniversary, Ubisoft announced Thursday during a Limited Run Games showcase. Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition will bring updated graphics, controls, and audio to the beloved original.
Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition will feature improved performance â âup to 4K, 60 fps,â Ubisoft said â and quality-of-life improvements including auto saves, cutscene skipping, controller and keyboard-and-mouse support, and cross-save across all platforms. All-new features include a speedrun mode, 20-plus new achievements and trophies, and a gallery that delves into the original gameâs development with never-before-seen artwork and videos.
The Beyond Good & Evil re-release may not be much of a surprise to longtime fans; the gameâs existence (and even an unfinished version of the remaster itself) leaked last fall.
The original Beyond Good & Evil was released in 2003 on GameCube, PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. Set more than 400 years in the future, the story of Beyond Good & Evil follows photojournalist Jade in her attempt to expose an alien conspiracy. Despite being a commercial miss, the game became a cult classic over the years. In 2017, Ubisoft announced a prequel named Beyond Good & Evil 2, but the publisher hasnât said much about it lately. The last official word on BG&E 2 came in 2021, when Ubisoft said the sequel was still in development. But the stars of Beyond Good & Evil â Jade and Peyâj â recently appeared in Ubisoftâs animated series Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix.
Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition will be released digitally on June 25, on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. A physical version (and a collectorâs edition) will be released by Limited Run Games. Pre-orders for the physical versions of Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition will go live on July 12.",https://www.polygon.com/24175512/beyond-good-evil-remaster-release-date-20th-anniversary,2024-06-20 20:32:23
New Elden Ring patch makes the final boss fight suck a lot less,"A new patch for Elden Ring was released Thursday, ostensibly to prepare the game for the arrival of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC on June 21. But players of the base game are also getting a lovely treat, in the form of a major quality-of-life update to the base gameâs final boss battle.
According to Bandai Namcoâs patch notes for version 1.12 of Elden Ring, developer FromSoftware has added a ânew feature to summon spectral steed during the Elden Beast boss battle.â Elden Ring players who have faced the Elden Beast will know what a relief it is to have Torrent available in this situation, as the final boss battle involves a torturous amount of running from one side of the battle arena to the other, back and forth, and back and forth again, while chasing the always-moving monster.
While the Elden Beast battle was a majestic and challenging final confrontation, the incessant running around players had to do to get in a few swipes of a sword or get within spellcasting range was something of a nightmare. Especially since the Elden Beast is a two-parter; one needs to defeat another boss, Radagon, before facing the beast, and failure in the second part meant repeating the first.
But the ability to summon Torrent in the Elden Beast boss fight isnât the only major quality-of-life update for Elden Ring in patch 1.12. FromSoft has added a new âRecent Itemsâ tab to playersâ inventory screen, letting them easily find the latest thing (weapon, cookbook, talisman, etc.) theyâve picked up. Newly obtained items are marked with a â!â symbol, which will be hugely important for players acquiring a ton of new stuff with Shadow of the Erdtree. (Note that the Recent Items tab is an opt-in feature in the gameâs settings menu, and having used it for the past week, I highly recommend turning it on!)
Elden Ring patch 1.12 does a whole lot more. There are new hairstyles, new PvP-exclusive balance adjustments, and a long list of weapon and skill tweaks, all of which are worth reviewing before diving into Shadow of the Erdtree for the first time.

The Penguin looks like a heaping helping of Gotham City mob drama,"September is not too far away, and The Penguin, Maxâs The Batman spinoff TV series, seems to know it. A new trailer for the show gets right down to it in a way that previous teases avoided: This is a cutthroat mafia succession story set in the dark and oily Gotham City showcased in Matt Reevesâ Robert Pattinson-led 2022 film. 
The Batman star Colin Farrell now has a whole cast to strive against in his quest to fill the power vacuum following the death of boss Carmine âThe Romanâ Falcone â and itâs a whoâs who of Gotham City mafia figures from the most influential mafia-focused Batman books. Clancy Brown plays Salvatore Maroni, the guy who threw acid in Harvey Dentâs face; Michael Kelly plays Johnny Viti, Falconeâs nephew and enforcer introduced in Batman: Year One; and Michael Zegen plays Alberto Falcone, a major player in Batman: The Long Halloween. Finally, Cristin Milioti plays a woman who appears to be Oswald âOzâ Cobbâs biggest rival for power, Sofia âGiganteâ Falcone, the daughter of The Roman. 
Weâll see who comes out on top â and whether Batman has anything to say about it â when The Penguin premieres on the Max streaming service in September.",https://www.polygon.com/24182425/batman-penguin-tv-series-hbo-max-colin-farrell,2024-06-20 16:10:00
"League of Legendsâ next champion is Aurora, a spirit walking bunny girl","The League of Legends roster is a huge and diverse, containing everything from a friendly boy scout badger to apocalyptic, world-ending threats. The newest champion looks friendly and approachable â but she also hangs out with primal spirits and ancient demigods. Meet Aurora, the Witch Between Worlds. Aurora is a mage that can play either in the mid or solo lane, and her abilities are defined by her vision of both the material realm and the spirit world.
Aurora is a vastayan, a vast culture of animal-like people spread across Runeterra. Sheâs a bunny-girl, complete with a big fluffy tail and long legs. She hails from the Freljord, and has connections with Ornn, Anivia, Volibear, and Udyr. Despite this, Aurora isnât invested in the big three-way war that takes place in most of the Freljord between the Avarosans, the Winterâs Claw, and the Frostguard. Sheâs much more focused on her own spiritual journey. 
Interestingly, Aurora is also on the autism spectrum; her unique way at looking at the world goes beyond just spiritual power. This is part of a larger attempt by Riot to increase representation on the champion roster and allow for a wider variety of characters, along with the addition of champions like Nilah, Renata Glasc, and KâSante.
Youâre in her realm now Get ready for Aurora, the Witch Between Worlds pic.twitter.com/ksWwNz4Wd7
Riot has released information on Auroraâs kit, which focuses on mobility, trickery, and ranged damage.
Passive â Spirit Abjuration 
If Aurora damages an enemy 3 times with her spells and attacks, she will deal magic damage and exorcise a spirit to her, entering Spirit Mode and gaining movement speed and empowering her healing for 3 seconds. For every additional spirit following Aurora, the bonuses from Spirit Mode are increased by 5%. 
Q â Twofold Hex 
Fire a blast of cursed energy in a direction, dealing magic damage to enemies hit and marking them with spirit energy. 
Recast: End the curse, drawing back the spirit energy to herself, dealing magic dealing to enemies passed through. 
W â Across the Veil 
Hop in a direction. Upon landing, enter the spirit realm, becoming Invisible and entering Spirit Mode for several seconds. 
Takedowns on enemy champions reset the cooldown of this ability. 
E â The Weirding 
Send out a blast of spirit magic dealing magic damage in an area and slowing them. Aurora will hop backwards slightly on cast. 
R â Between Worlds 
Send out a pulse of spirit energy that deals magic damage and slows enemies. The area merges with the spirit realm, granting Aurora an empowered spirit mode, and allowing her to travel from one end of the area to the other. Enemies who try to cross the threshold will take magic damage, be slowed, and be pushed back toward the center of the area.
Aurora will release in Patch 14.14, which is scheduled for July 17. The champion was originally teased in the League of Legends client, with a story that allowed the player to see Aurora meeting with the demigod Ornn.",https://www.polygon.com/24182434/league-of-legends-aurora-champion-reveal-splash-art-ability-kit,2024-06-20 16:01:01
Smile 2 is making good on the originalâs viral marketing gimmick,"The first Smile was a pretty good horror movie and a pretty massive hit. While those two facts are closely related, at least part of the movieâs cultural impact was thanks to its incredible marketing campaign where people showed up to high-profile events like sports games sporting the seriesâ trademark unnatural grin. It didnât have much to do with the movie, but it was undeniably effective. Thankfully, the first trailer for Smile 2, the seriesâ big-budget sequel, is here to make good on the originalâs marketing stunt.
Smile relied mostly on intimate, small-scale scares and the creepy idea that the person youâre talking to could be infected by the Smile curse without you even knowing it. The main character, Rose (Sosie Bacon), watched the curse spread through the various members of her life until she finally understood what was causing it. 
But the marketing campaign got at something much big and more sinister. Having normal(ish) people sitting at baseball games and grinning for the camera, implied something massive, an unknowable infection of sporadic unexplainable violence accompanied with an ear to ear smile and wide vacant eyes. Thankfully, this is the deep well that the new movie seems to be tapping into. 
Hereâs some fun, clever movie promo - Paramount seemingly placed #Smile actors in the crowd at both the Yankees and Mets games last night, both in view of cameras. The results were indeed creepy. Going to a game this weekend? Watch out for the smiles!   pic.twitter.com/aC3sqZjWvI
The trailer for the new movie primarily follows pop star Skye Riley (Naomi Scott), who seems to be in the middle of a massive nation-wide stadium tour â a popular venue for horror movies this year. Of course, smiles start to creep through the crowd and her fans without any explanation, and violence follows. 
It all looks far bigger and more expensive, but with the same methodical slow-paced scares that made the first movie so effective. And, even more importantly, adding in throngs of people makes the seriesâ signature grins even more terrifying, making the cursed victims stand out in the crowd, exactly like they did at the baseball games from the original promotions. 
Smile 2 is written and directed by Parker Finn, just like the original movie, and is set for release in theaters on Oct. 18.",https://www.polygon.com/24181195/smile-2-trailer-release-date-cast-sequel-concert,2024-06-18 19:43:00
Valheim: The Board Game boils your server down to a 2-hour play session,"Valheim: The Board Game was built off the success of Deep Rock Galactic: The Board Game, another tabletop adaptation of a popular video game that aims to keep the same vibe as the original. With Deep Rock Galactic, itâs easier to create a one-to-one experience â a match in the video game is a round of the board game. But Valheim is a sprawling experience thatâs harder to encapsulate. Valheim: The Board Game is coming to crowdfunding on Gamefound later this year.
Playing on a Valheim server with a cohort of pals is a big experience, made up of weeks and months of farming, building, adventure, boss fighting, and general Viking antics. So how does the board game adaptation boil all of that down into a two-hour session? Itâs no easy feat, but the designers looked to Valheimâs biomes and the altars that summon bosses like Bonemass or The Elder.
âThe video game is expansive. Not only is it a typical adventure, but you start with nothing. You have to create a home as well. I think of it as an adult version of Minecraft,â says Ole Steiness, lead designer of Valheim: The Board Game. âWhat weâve done is taken the same core concept and then divided it into scenarios of a larger campaign.â
Each session of the board game represents a scenario of a larger Valheim life in the 10th realm. âYou have to develop yourself and your home to be able to take on this challenge,â says Steiness. âYouâre going to explore the map, which is going to be tiles on the board, and youâll have events going on and creatures showing up to challenge you. As you fight your way through it, you gather resources so you and your friends can build up, make a cool character, a cool home, until you take on the big boss fight at the end of the game.â
Different sessions of Valheim: The Board Game will have different layouts and scenarios that play out over a two-hour game session. Not all of the scenarios will be tests of martial prowess. âIt was important to both us and Iron Gate [the developer of Valheim] that itâs not only about killing stuff â itâs about developing other traits and making sure that other parts work. Some people find it fun to build a house, or some people want to go explore. We have a 3D model of your home in the game, and itâs an empty house you have to fill out.â
In Valheim, new furniture and workbenches at the homestead raise your comfort level and allow you to craft new gear. Thatâs true in Valheim: The Board Game as well, which allows players to linger at home to enhance their equipment and build armor while others venture out into the Black Forest to kill monsters. In order to refine these roles, there are character archetypes: The Ranger is probably out scouting and fighting trolls, while the Sailor is focusing on securing naval routes, and the Gatherer gathers up everything needed for a nutritious stew. Everyone can do everything, but these roles allow players to specialize in a way similar to the original game.
The board will also change depending on the boss youâre fighting. Bonemass, for instance, will cause the board to be populated with more swamp biomes and poison tiles. When the endgame begins, the players flip the board, revealing a boss arena for the final showdown. 
Valheim: The Board Game will be available to back on Gamefound later in 2024. More details will be released on Valheimâs X feed and community Discord as they become available.",https://www.polygon.com/24180447/valheim-the-board-game-mood-publishing-crowdfunding,2024-06-18 17:00:00
Original Dragon Quest trilogy getting the âHD-2Dâ remake treatment,"The long-awaited âHD-2Dâ remake of classic Enix role-playing game Dragon Quest 3 is coming to Nintendo Switch this November, publisher Square Enix announced Tuesday during a Nintendo Direct showcase. But Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D isnât the only classic Erdrick adventure coming from Square Enix â the collection Dragon Quest 1 & 2 HD-2D was also announced Tuesday, giving fans of Akira Toriyama and Yuji Horiiâs RPG series a lavishly remade trilogy to enjoy over the next year.
Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D will send players on a remade fantasy adventure as The Hero to take down the archfiend Baramos, traveling to towns, dungeons, and underground caves, and battling slimes and other Toriyama-designed monsters in turn-based battles. The original Dragon Quest 3 is set before the events of the first two games in the series, so, chronologically, playing Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D first will prep you for the next two games.
Square Enix didnât say much about whatâs changing for Dragon Quest 1 & 2 HD-2D, or whether they will feature expanded narratives as Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D will, but that seems quite likely.
Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D will be released on Nov. 14 on Nintendo Switch. Dragon Quest 1 & 2 HD-2D are due sometime in 2025.
Square Enixâs brand of HD-2D games started with developer Acquireâs retro RPG Octopath Traveler in 2018. The RPG publisher saw the potential in HD-2D for both new releases and remakes; the style has since been employed for Octopath Traveler 2 and tactics RPG Triangle Strategy, with plans for more remakes beyond the early Dragon Quest games.",https://www.polygon.com/24180967/dragon-quest-hd-2d-nintendo-switch,2024-06-18 15:42:59
"Perfect Dark, Metroid, and multiplayer Legend of Zelda are all coming to Nintendoâs subscription service","Nintendo announced a small, but mighty list of additions heading to its premium subscription service as part of the Nintendo Direct on Tuesday. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords; Metroid: Zero Mission; Turok: Dinosaur Hunter; and Perfect Dark are all being released to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on Tuesday.
Any title on its own would be a formidable addition to the catalog of games offered on the subscription service, but now we get all four. Metroid: Zero Mission is a classic Metroid game and highly regarded as one of the best entries in the series. Turok: Dinosaur Hunter takes players back to some good prehistoric hunting and exploring on the Nintendo 64. As for Perfect Dark, there couldnât be a better time to revisit the original given that the reboot just got a big gameplay trailer at the recent Xbox Games Showcase â and the game will have online multiplayer. 
Then, of course, thereâs another Zelda game. The standard Nintendo Switch Online already contains the NES version of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, but now people will be able to play the quirkier Four Swords addition to the game that came out to the GameBoy Advance in 2002. The best part? This game will also have online multiplayer so now those who didnât have enough copies of the game (or enough handhelds) as kids might finally be able to revisit and play the classic with friends. 
An individual subscription to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack costs $49.99 per year or you can also buy a family membership that costs $79.99 per year and can include up to eight users.

Everything announced at Nintendo Direct June 2024,"Though Nintendo didnât show its upcoming Switch successor during its Nintendo Direct broadcast Tuesday, the company outlined its release schedule for the second half of 2024. The June Nintendo Direct ran for 40 minutes and showcased everything expected in the coming months, including a brand new Zelda game.

Thereâs plenty left on the Nintendo schedule to hold eager fans over until Nintendoâs next console is revealed.

Metroid Prime 4 was first announced in 2017, but itâs been a long time since weâve heard anything else. This is the first look, and Nintendo is not expecting its release until 2025; development had to be restarted in 2019 under Retro Studios.

"Metroid Prime 4 trailer shows first gameplay, 2025 release date","After years of anticipation (and a major development shakeup), Nintendo gave fans a first look at Metroid Prime 4 during Tuesdayâs Nintendo Direct. The game is now known as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and it will come to Switch in 2025, Nintendo said.
The first trailer for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond features some actual gameplay, with galactic bounty hunter Samus Aran battling hordes of space pirates, scanning alien environments for clues, and going into ball mode to traverse the environment. It was all classic Metroid stuff, and a tease of a very exciting adventure to come.
Metroid fans also got a peek at what appears to be Metroid Prime 4: Beyondâs villain, a space pirate commander who commands two Metroids as pets. 
Nintendo first announced that a new entry in the Metroid Prime series was in the works at E3 2017. At that time, the company only showed a logo for the game, and since then has not provided game details or shown gameplay. At E3 2018, Nintendo did not showcase the game, saying it did not want to repeatedly tease fans until the game was closer to completion. Then, in 2019, Nintendo said it was rebooting development of Metroid Prime 4 and shifting the project to Retro Studios, the Metroid Prime seriesâ original developer.
Metroid Prime 4 marks the return of the popular take on the classic adventure series, which debuted on Nintendo GameCube and was last seen on Wii with 2007âs Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.
Metroid Prime 3âs follow-up was Metroid: Other M, a Wii game that failed to win over fans of Samus Aranâs intergalactic adventures. Nintendo never made a Metroid game for Wii U, although it released a reimagining of Metroid 2: Samus Returns for Nintendo 3DS in 2017. Samusâ most recent adventure, Metroid Dread, was released on Nintendo Switch in October 2021. That was followed by Metroid Prime Remastered for Switch in early 2023.",https://www.polygon.com/18128959/metroid-prime-4-release-date-trailer-nintendo-switch,2024-06-18 14:47:10
New Legend of Zelda game finally makes Zelda the playable hero of Hyrule,"The next Legend of Zelda game will give Princess Zelda herself the starring role. Nintendo announced The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom during its latest Nintendo Direct showcase, confirming that the Zelda-led adventure will come to Switch later this year.
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom looks a lot like 2019âs remake of The Legend of Zelda: Linkâs Awakening from a graphical perspective, but it will play very differently. Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma said that Echoes of Wisdom will feature âa new gameplay style that breaks conventions;â in other words, Zelda wonât just fight like Link. Instead, sheâll use a new magical rod, the Tri Rod, and the power of wisdom to create and duplicate objects to help her overcome obstacles and enemies.

    Related
  
Those duplicated objects are known as echoes, Nintendo says, and include things like water blocks that can be used as platforms, beds that can be repurposed into bridges, and even enemies that will fight alongside Zelda and her fairy friend Tri.
Out on Switch Sept. 26, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the first Nintendo-developed game to explicitly star Zelda as the main protagonist. Typically, hero duties are reserved for Link, and longtime Nintendo fans have hoped for decades that Zelda would get a heroic turn in the series that bears her name.
Princess Zelda has been playable in a handful of games from Nintendo and other developers over the past four decades. Sheâs a playable character in spinoffs like the Hyrule Warriors action games, the Super Smash Bros. series, and in rhythm game Cadence of Hyrule. In 2009âs The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, players take control of a version of Zelda, in spirit form, during segments of the game.
Two Zelda-starring games that Nintendo would likely prefer to forget are 1993âs Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and 1996âs Zeldaâs Adventure, a pair of interactive adventures developed for the Philips CD-i multimedia player.

A brand-new Mario & Luigi adventure is coming to Switch,"A new Mario & Luigi adventure â Mario & Luigi: Brothership â is coming to Switch this November, Nintendo announced Tuesday at its latest Nintendo Direct. Itâs the first new Mario & Luigi game in nine years; the last was 2015âs Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam for Nintendo 3DS. 
In the first trailer for Mario & Luigi: Brothership, we see Mario and Luigi facing an all-new electrical threat, and joined by electric plug-inspired allies Connie and Snoutlet, on their seafaring adventure. More familiar friends and foes â Princess Peach and Bowser and his minions â are also here. In Mario & Luigi tradition, the plumber-adventurer duo team up to use evolved Bros. moves in combat and for platforming as they adventure through the world of Concordia. 
Helping the bros get around is a part-ship, part-island method of transport known as Shipshape Island. The ship-island will take them to a variety of environments, ranging from tropical rainforests to bustling cities, Nintendo said in an announcement.
Mario & Luigi: Brothership sets sail for Nintendo Switch on Nov. 7. It will be the sixth entry in the Mario & Luigi series of action-role-playing games, which started with 2003âs Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga for Game Boy Advance. Itâs unclear who is developing Brothership, as former Mario & Luigi developer AlphaDream shuttered in 2019.",https://www.polygon.com/24180950/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-release-date,2024-06-18 14:16:14
Hello Kitty Island Adventure is coming to Nintendo Switch and other consoles ,"Hello Kitty Island Adventure, an adorable life-sim featuring a cast of Sanrio characters, has been freed from Apple Arcade jail. Developer Sunblink and Sanrio announced the game will be released on the Nintendo Switch and Windows PC in 2025. After that, it will also come to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, a release said. The developer shared the news via a trailer as part of the Nintendo Direct on Tuesday. 
Hello Kitty Island Adventure has all the fixings of an adorable life-sim and then some. You can design an adorable character, collect materials, craft, fish, and explore alongside a rather large cast of Sanrio characters. The game, which was originally released on iOS via Apple Arcade in summer 2023, continues to be updated by the development team. The developers released a mermaid-inspired update as recently as May and the flowery Merry Meadow to celebrate spring.
Fans of Animal Crossing: New Horizons might immediately notice parallels between the two games both in terms of the cutesy art style and gameplay. Hello Kitty Island Adventure definitely goes a lot harder on the âadventureâ part of it all â you spend a lot of time climbing and exploring in Island Adventure â but it could be a great option for Animal Crossing fans looking for a game to hold them over until the release of the Nintendo Switch successor.",https://www.polygon.com/24180426/hello-kitty-island-adventure-nintendo-switch-windows-pc-release,2024-06-18 14:10:10
"Octopath Traveler 2, Callisto Protocol lead a June 2024 Game Pass update","Xboxâs bow at Summer Game Fest solidified major plans for the Game Pass service in 2025. But thatâs the future. The Game Pass of June 2024 is... a bit lighter. 
Following a similarly short May lineup, June offers lauded RPG Octopath Traveler has returned to the platform along with its slightly less lauded but equally gorgeous-looking sequel Octopath Traveler 2. Dead Space fans should be keen to try The Callisto Protocol, a 2022 sci-fi survival horror game that wasnât a total knockout but had plenty of the DNA that made Dead Space games great â basically the ideal Game Pass game? Those looking for something new should keep eyes peeled on Still Wakes the Deep, horror game set on an oil rig thatâs going day 1 on the service. 
From 3D farm sims like My Time at Sandrock to 2D RPGs like Keplerth, a more minor June still has a little something for everyone. Hereâs the lineup.
The end of June and start of July will also see a number of other titles leaving Game Pass â nothing too notable, though.",https://www.polygon.com/xbox/24172968/game-pass-june-2024-free-xbox-games-octopath-traveler-2-callisto-protocol,2024-06-18 13:57:54
Watch the new Nintendo Direct for a look at the Switch 2024 lineup,"Nintendo will broadcast a new Nintendo Direct presentation on Tuesday, June 18, a showcase focused on Switch titles coming in 2024.
Juneâs Nintendo Direct will run for about 40 minutes and will start at 10 a.m. EDT/7 a.m. PDT. The showcase will stream on Nintendoâs YouTube and Twitch channels. Nintendo tempered expectations for the showcase in a news release on Monday: âThere will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation,â the company said.
Nintendo only has a couple of Switch games with confirmed release dates at the moment: Luigiâs Mansion 2 HD and Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition. Of course, the company may have a few surprises in store. Nintendo still has Metroid Prime 4 on its schedule, and itâs rumored to be sitting on a handful of remakes and remasters of its past games.
Confirmed not to appear during Juneâs Nintendo Direct is the companyâs next console. In May, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said in a public announcement, âWe will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.â The company reiterated that message in Mondayâs news release â no console news.
The âSwitch 2â is reportedly coming sometime in early 2025, and we may not hear official details from Nintendo on that next-gen console until this fall or winter.

Sim game Life By You canceled after 3 early access delays,"Life By You, Paradox Interactiveâs potential The Sims 4 competitor, has been canceled. Paradox Interactive deputy CEO Mattias Lilja announced the gameâs cancellation in a post on the publisherâs forum. âSadly, weâve decided to cancel the release of our long-awaited life sim Life by You,â Lilja wrote. âThis was an incredibly difficult call to make and is a clear failure on Paradoxâs part to meet both our own and the communityâs expectations.â
Life By You was last scheduled for its early access release on June 4, but Paradox delayed the game indefinitely on May 20. The May delay was the third time the early access release was pushed back â it was first intended for September 2023, March 5, then June 4. Lilja said the game had âincremental improvementsâ with each delay, but that the road to release was âfar too long and uncertain.â Hereâs Lilja on the delay:
A few weeks back, we decided to hold off on an Early Access release in order to re-evaluate Life by You, as we still felt that the game was lacking in some key areas. Though a time extension was an option, once we took that pause to get a wider view of the game, it became clear to us that the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain. This is not to say the game has not shown any promising qualities; Life by You had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realizing them. However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop. This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process.
At the end of the day, our job is to release games that are fun, interesting, and challenging for our players, and our every decision should be taken with that purpose in mind. When we get that right, we earn our pay. So, how do we ensure we donât find ourselves here again? Honestly, there are no real guarantees. Games are difficult to get right, and weâll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldnât reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and weâll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that.
In a news release published on the Paradox Interactive website, CEO Fredik Wester said a version of Life By You that met the publisherâs expectations was âtoo far away.â Paradox Interactive is expecting its second quarter financial results to be ânegatively impactedâ by the gameâs write-down of development costs â adding to a poor performance with recent releases, according to Wester.
âWeâve performed poorly in recent releases,â Wester said. âEven though we now start new projects in a different manner, it is clear that we must make further changes so that quality is more consistent and the promises we make to our players are met. We have to evaluate how we manage projects and how we organize, for we will and must get better. We have a very solid financial position and a strong core game portfolio, which keeps us confident about our future.â
Paradox announced Paradox Tectonic, the studio tasked with developing Life By You, in 2019. Led by former Sims lead and Second Life creator Linden Labs CEO Rod Humble, Paradox Tectonic officially announced Life By You in 2023. Life By You was expected to stand out from the crowded life sim genre with deeper roleplaying elements. With the cancellation of Life By You, that genre just got a little less crowded â but thereâs still Paralives, inZOI, Project Rene (aka The Sims 5) and an unnamed life simulator from Midsummer Studios.

Habbo Hotel going vintage with original game rerelease,"The Habbo Hotel community â yes, thereâs still a community â is celebrating the announcement of Habbo Hotel Origins, a rerelease of the original game as it was in 2005. Habbo Hotel Origins goes live Tuesday; developer Sulake has been restoring the game for six months after it found âan old decrepit server with some long-lost files.â
Habbo Hotel has remained in existence (with plenty of ups and downs) since 2000, and people have been playing it since. It had a particularly large resurgence in 2020 during the pandemic. With all the tweaks and adjustments over the past 20 years, the modern version of Habbo Hotel looks a lot different than your childhood nostalgia. Habbo Hotel Origins is intended to fix that. âThe simplicity, charm and magic of that early version of Habbo are things we want to retain and protect, so we intend to be careful about what we add, and when,â Sulake wrote on the Habbo Hotel Origins website.
we're bringing back habbo hotel as it existed in 2005                                   !#HabboHotelOrigins pic.twitter.com/kcuM9OHuWQ
Sulake wrote that Habbo Hotel Origins will be âcommunity-led;â the InfoBus Park is now a âdemocratic forumâ where players can vote on changes to the game.
The Habbo Hotel Origins Reddit page is awash with celebration: The old times are back! There are some caveats to that, though: Habbo Hotel Origins wonât support casinos or any type of gambling, despite the game being for people 18 years or older. Habbo Hotel Origins wonât have any NFTs, either, unlike Habbo Hotel.
Sulake intends to keep Habbo Hotel Origins alive as long as the game sustains itself.",https://www.polygon.com/24180314/habbo-hotel-2005-origins-release,2024-06-17 18:38:47
Helldivers 2 dev made a donation to Save the Children because players chose to save the children,"It turns out even slightly mean philosophical pranks by the developers of satirical wargames can have a heartwarming ending. Last week, Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios issued players with a new Major Order, and a stark moral choice: save a hospital of sick kids from an army of killer robots, or earn the cool anti-tank mines theyâve always wanted (at the third time of asking).
En masse, players selflessly chose the sick kids, and now they get their just reward: feeling good about themselves. Arrowheadâs chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt revealed on X that the studio had made a $4,311 donation to Save the Children to commemorate the communityâs in-game generosity.
Since the @helldivers2 community chose to save the children, @arrowheadgs does the same. We have made a donation to, well, Save the Children.Great job Divers!https://t.co/080PL27Y1u pic.twitter.com/yNhpiFWMlz
The good vibes continued within the game lore, too. The studioâs official Helldivers 2 account shared an adorable sketch of a smiling child holding hands with a Helldiver (next to a burning alien skull) and the following in-fiction message:
Dear Helldivers,
Thank you so much for saving us. They told us you made a lot of sacrifices (mines/lives) to help us. Weâll always be grateful. Now, we can grow up to become Helldivers too.
With Liberty,The Very Sick Children of Super Citizen Anneâs
We also have a special message to share with you:""Dear Helldivers,Thank you so much for saving us. They told us you made a lot of sacrifices (mines/lives) to help us. We'll always be grateful.

Fallout 76 finally stands triumphant â and thereâs more to come,"Itâs been a long, hard road for Fallout 76 â but one that has finally led to a triumphant peak. The gameâs disastrous launch has been covered a thousand times from every angle; it was an intricate mess of overlapping problems that made the game difficult to play and extremely clippable for memes. But in 2024, the beleaguered game is stepping into the spotlight and enjoying a wave of positive attention. Bethesda has spent years patching up the ship, adding NPCs, companions, quests, Expeditions, factions, a battle royale mode, and more cryptids than you can shake a stick at.
The Fallout show on Amazon Prime kickstarted a wave of interest in everything Fallout; Steam charts have shown that every game in the franchise has found a new player base. The games published under Bethesdaâs umbrella are Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 4. Each of these RPGs is a meaty campaign with enough content â and player-made mods â to sustain its own fandom of players. But Fallout 5 is a ways out, and Fallout 4 is nearly a decade old. The game best suited to draw in new fans who were hoping for just general Fallout vibes is Fallout 76.
âItâs no secret that Fallout 76 had some bumps at release,â said creative director Jonathan Rush in an email interview with Polygon. But even in its earliest days, Fallout 76 was defined by its enthusiastic community. These were players who loved the game, warts and all, and stuck around. It was largely because of these fans that I was able to eke out enjoyment of Fallout 76, and Iâve returned to the game on and off over the years, sampling from these delights. Early on, the high points came from other players, and uncovering the stories of the dead who came before.
âThe characters that initially launched with 76 were nuclear shadows, whose purpose was to tell the story of what all had happened between [when] the bombs drop and the point where you emerge from Vault 76,â said Rush. âSince Appalachia was initially devoid of human life, we relied on these characters as tools to give our players an understanding of the new world they had emerged into.â
But without characters in the world, and dialogue trees, Fallout 76 was missing much of the je ne sais quoi that makes a Fallout game. While the community team gathered feedback and part of the team provided smaller-scale updates and bug fixes, a larger group got to work on Wastelanders, the first expansion that added NPCs and a main quest to the game. âThe development for Wastelanders started very soon after launch and was a huge effort which involved all Bethesda Game Studios locations,â said Rush. âOn these types of games, itâs difficult to only support one of those â a dedicated group to maintain the integrity of the live service is crucial.â
Some of these updates have been much more experimental than others. Looking over the list of updates shows a healthy amount of variety. Nuclear Winter was a battle royale mode, engineered by a fictional in-game super-AI and rich with cosmetic rewards. Steel Dawn was a two-part narrative update that had players fight alongside the Brotherhood of Steel, learning more about the enigmatic order. The Pitt and Atlantic City were host to Expeditions, new maps outside of the main zone of Appalachia. Now, with the most recent Skyline Valley update, Bethesda is expanding the original map to include a weird, dangerous area to explore in the south. The bigger structural updates have been peppered with smaller experiments: killer aliens, grilling meat with a super mutant and his brahmin buddy, mothman cults, and new tools for building comfier CAMPs.
âWeâre thankful to our community for giving us all the feedback and criticism they did so we could narrow our focus and fix the most critical issues,â said Rush. âWe feel that because of everything we went through with the game and the community, we have a strong and open dialogue with our fans to keep the game updated in the most impactful way for our players.
âHaving an awesome Community team that listens to the feedback and effectively communicates it back to the developers was a tremendous benefit; knocking down the walls between the developers and the players is the key so we can have constructive discourse where both sides feel engaged,â Rush added.
Not every experiment was successful; Nuclear Winter was removed, some events were quietly retired, and some quests are more fondly regarded than others. But combined with greater stability and sense of identity, the new updates have transformed Fallout 76 from a clown fiesta to a genuinely compelling game in a No Manâs Sky-esque redemption arc.
When looking back at past updates, Rush considers the most important lesson to be this: âOur players really love to play in our Appalachia. What I mean by this is, I look at Appalachia as the main character for this game, and the story is told by how it changes over time â both on the developer side, and through our players.â
Skyline Valley, the latest update, is an example of what expanding on Appalachia can be. While Expeditions require the player to jump on a vertibird and fly off to some distant locale, Skyline Valley changes the map weâve been exploring since 2018. âExpanding the borders of our map gives us additional opportunities to flesh out the world further through stories, new locations, and the inhabitants within,â Rush explained.
There are more updates on the way for Fallout 76, and by this point, the designers have figured out what works for the game. Experiments like the Burrows, or the Pitt, werenât always perfect â but they proved what worked and what didnât. Throughout this entire process, Fallout 76 has been backed by a brilliantly creative community of players who build CAMPs, tell cinematic stories, work as doctors, recreate Shakespeareâs productions, or run charity drives.
I recently loaded into Fallout 76 to play with a friend who had just downloaded the game, and we rocked up to an event. Once it concluded, the veterans ran up to my friend and dropped a couple of bags chock-full of goods â a welcoming gesture toward a new player, and a common ritual among longtime veterans.

Talismanâs 5th edition will feature a cooperative expansion for the first time,"Talisman: The Magical Quest Game, one of the OG dungeon crawlers, is back with a 5th edition release arriving on July 1. But Hasbroâs Avalon Hill imprint has more than just retro vibes on its mind. The company has also revealed Talisman: Alliances - Fate Beckons, an expansion arriving alongside the revamped board game. It will offer a cooperative mode of play for the first time in the franchiseâs 41-year history.
âWhen we were thinking about 5th edition, we didnât want to just reprint those old expansions and just recreate the existing content,â said strategic brand manager Patrick OâRourke in a press briefing earlier this week. âWe set out to explore âmore.â We wanted more game modes that could open the Talisman platform to more players and additional playstyles. And thatâs why we created Talisman: Alliances.â
In a traditional game of Talisman, players take on the roles of adventurers in the style of fantasy role-playing games â classes such as fighter, wizard, cleric, and thief. They utilize special powers and abilities in their quest for a mighty MacGuffin called the Crown of Command. Itâs a somewhat linear journey, and it often includes players fighting against one another. Alliances will upend that tradition by presenting players with a series of Trials that must be dealt with cooperatively, each one sealed inside a small cardboard box. 
âInstead of claiming the Crown or Command for yourself to win,â said associate brand manager Cait Drouin, âyouâll bury the Talismans in places of power, unseal the Portal of Power, and then defeat the adversary together. So players will need to share resources and fate to work together to complete five Trials with some very exciting surprises along the way.â
While we donât know for sure whatâs inside the boxes, it does appear to be miniature of some kind. The back of the game box says youâll âreveal unique mystery figuresâ as you go. So what are those figures? Our only clues are game materials that show a robed figure with a deer skull for a head; a conflagration with green-eyed monsters crawling out of it; a hero being pulled down by a mob; and a mysterious armored warrior holding a flag over a battlefield.
Avalon Hill stressed that Alliances is not a legacy-style game. Game designer Doug Hopkins stressed that there are no stickers, no writing on the game board, and no destroying of components.
âWeâre [...] rolling out the experience to you one trial at a time,â Hopkins said. âYouâll get that thrill of when you complete the trial to unlock the next box and see whatâs inside and then, of course, unlock the next trial so that hopefully you can watch the story unfold through multiple game sessions.â

NewJeans is the PUBG collab I didnât know I needed,"It seems like no world â physical nor digital â is immune to the girly pop flair of NewJeans. The globally famous K-pop group made its debut in PlayerUnknownâs Battlegrounds as part of the 30.1 update on Wednesday. The collaboration adds each member of the group as a playable character, adorable accessories to dress up your characters, emotes for popular dances set to songs like âOMG,â and more. Equal parts bizarre and wonderful, the PUBG update has already captured the fascination of fans online. 
Krafton released the NewJeans x PUBG: Battlegrounds collaboration on Wednesday to Windows PC users and will release it to console users on June 20. The PC patch has introduced some environmental changes as well. For example, the Taego School has been transformed into a sparkly rainbow wonderland and thereâs now a pink and purple truck stage on the starting island of every 8 km map. You can play as any member of NewJeans â Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, or Hyein â and dress your character up in adorable pastel accessories. You can view all the details on the PUBG site. 
The collaboration brings a vibrant pop of color to the gritty world of PUBG. Just like other live-service games, PUBG is no stranger to surprising collaborations. PUBG has featured collaborations with the anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion and other games like Angry Birds. Despite that, the NewJeans collab manages to stick out from previous events and now people online are sharing videos showing the girls emoting in the game. The dances just look that good. Here is a video of Minji from NewJeans doing several dances from songs like âSuper Shyâ and âOMG.â

The Jackbox Megapicker solves the biggest issue with the Party Packs,"The Jackbox Party Packs are getting a much-needed quality of life improvement â a singular source from which all Jackboxes may flow. Today, Jackbox Games announced The Jackbox Megapicker, a free product for Steam that allows players to put their various Game Packs under one umbrella. The Megapicker will release in July.
As a regular Jackbox Games host, I can attest this has been sorely needed. There are a lot of minigames over the 10 Jackbox Party Packs â over 50, in fact, and while some of them are made redundant by sequels, thereâs still a couple of games from every pack worth revisiting.
That variety is why Jackbox is such a party pleaser. Guesspionages is a clever little guessing game thatâs novel and not too competitive, while Survive the Internet allows for my friends and I to assail each other with the worst possible takes imaginable. Push the Button is a chaotic experience with lots of yelling and blaming, while Job Job is a much more chill and goofy experience. Thereâs something for everyone.
But when playing with friends, it immediately becomes awkward to have to shut the stream down, open up a new Party Pack, check and make sure Extended Timers is toggled on, and restart the stream. Admittedly itâs a pretty small gripe in the grand scheme of things, but itâs one thatâs persisted for a decade, so the Megapicker is a nice thing to have. The developers will be hosting an AMA on Reddit closer to the launch, where they will share more information and answer fan questions.

Ahri ban rate soars after ultra expensive new League of Legends skin drops,"League of Legendsâ latest skin has proven controversial with the community. The Immortalized Legend Ahri skin was designed to commemorate Faker as the first pro player inducted into Riotâs League of Legends esports Hall of Fame, called the Hall of Legends. To mark the occasion, the skin has an optional extra tier that costs about $500 to unlock. While many fans objected to the price tag online right away, their displeasure has now moved in-game, with Ahriâs ban rate suddenly skyrocketing after her new skinâs release. 
The skin arrived in patch 14.12, which hit servers on Wednesday. Since then, Ahri has gone from being banned in about 8% of ranked games to being banned in over 15% of ranked games, according to Lolalytics. While the uptick in bans is true globally, itâs most pronounced in North America, going from around 10% to over 23%, suggesting that either NA players hate this skin a little bit more than the rest of the world, or the regionâs ranked players are more committed to sending a message than ranking up â a theory that the regionâs Worlds results certainly back up. 
This type of change in bans is usually reserved for champions who get substantial in-game buffs, or with enormously high win rates, but neither is true for Ahri. In this case, it really seems to be all about the skin â which gives no practical in-game bonuses unless you count opulence and pride as psychological buffs.
With no meaningful buffs, this admittedly funny banning trend is likely to correct itself in the near future, which means that soon enough Leagueâs biggest spenders will get to show off their shiny new skin.

The Division 2âs new season comes with a genius triple plot twist,"The Division franchise is best known for being a post-apocalyptic looter shooter, set in an alternate timeline where society collapsed due to a large-scale biological attack. Since The Divisionâs launch in 2016, Ubisoftâs developers have been telling a long-running story around a mysterious rogue agent. The Division 2âs most recent update includes a twist that is so implausible and goofy that it wraps all the way back around to being a work of genius.
In these games, the Strategic Homeland Division is a government agency that is embedded in society until times of great catastrophe, in which case its members are activated as super-cops aided by ISAC, a state-of-the-art AI. In the first game, the player meets with local Division leader Faye Lau, the two of them nearly get murdered, and then the player is authorized to start shooting and subsequently looting their way through New York City. 
In between boss fights and collectible hunting, the player is introduced to the narrative thread that the Division is actually a bad idea for a crisis response team. A bunch of them have gone rogue, and the worst of them all is a real bad egg called Aaron Keener. Keener remains a background presence in the gameâs lore for a while, only emerging to tell us about the recent bioterrorism he planned or all the good schemes he was enjoying.
The mystery mounted over years. I played through The Division 2âs campaign looking out for any sign of him among my new Division colleagues. One character, Agent Kelso, really seemed like she was going to betray me. She even disappeared for a long time during a crucial mission and reemerged with suspicious timing. But none of my suspicions immediately paid off, and the Black Tusk paramilitary group became the primary threat.
It wasnât until the 2020 expansion Warlords of New York that players were finally able to confront Keener. The expansion was full of twists and turns, like Faye Lau murdering the president and framing the Division for the crime in a shocking double-cross. But players finally got to fight Keener as a boss, so thatâs over with, right? 
Itâs not over with. Youâve fallen right into Aaron Keenerâs trap, you gullible rube. Heâs alive and kicking ass.
Ubisoft helpfully explained the new status quo in a blog post, which reads in part:
Year 5 Season 3 ended with a shocking revelation, Rogue agent number one and sworn nemesis of The Division, Aaron Keener is alive. In her hunt for truth, Agent Kelso located him and decided to join forces with him.
The line between light and dark, agent and rogue, keeps blurring as we learned that Keener was working with Faye Lau to undermine the Black Tusk and neutralize the Hunter threat during the events of Warlords of New York.
Keener is coming to Washington, D.C. and he has sent us an invitation to parley, but first we will need to pass his twisted trials and prove our worth. An alliance with Keener and his Rogues could be the key to stopping Natalya Sokolova and the Black Tusk. But what will the cost be? 
Can Keener be trusted? Is the enemy of our enemy truly our friend?
As someone who had kept abreast of The Division 2âs developing story, my reaction to reading this missive and learning this information was âIâm sorry, what?â Thereâs a lot of double-crosses to sort through, especially since the line between light and dark keeps blurring!
I hear you asking: âWait, if Keenerâs a boss in the game who players murder, didnât players see him die?â You fool. You absolute buffoon. Keener hacked ISAC so it just looked like he was dead. But heâs alive, and now he wants to tell you his real agenda, as long as you can survive his Joker traps...
Sir, I have been trying to find you and have a conversation for many years straight, so Iâm starting to think youâre just a messy bitch who loves the drama. On the other hand, the audacity of this creative choice wins me over. Of course Keener is a super-genius who faked his own death by hacking your brain. Otherwise, heâd just be a guy in a hoodie recording brooding monologues for colleagues to find, and thatâs not very fun.
The Division 2âs next update includes other content and tweaks, as well as allowing players to access the endgame without purchasing Warlords of New York. Many fans seem surprised to see that The Division 2 is still receiving updates, but Ubisoft has been supporting the game â as well as many of its other titles â with years of post-launch support. When that strategy leads to story beats this brilliant, I definitely support it. ",https://www.polygon.com/24177264/the-division-2-first-rogue-year-6-aaron-keener-plot-twists,2024-06-13 19:15:00
PS5 is finally integrating Discord into the consoleâs UI,"PlayStation 5-havers rejoice â Sony PlayStation announced Thursday that the PS5 will be getting Discord integration. According to the PlayStation blog, the new feature will roll out to users in the âcoming weeks.â At long last, youâll be able to play Fortnite and other multiplatform games with your dear PS5 friends without fudging around within different in-game chats. 
Sony PlayStation, which owns a minority stake in Discord, promised integration with the chatting service as far back as 2021. Itâs not that there was no way to use Discord as a PlayStation 5 user, but prior use required other external apps and workarounds to use it. Now PlayStation users will be able to log on to chats directly from the console, âwithout relying on the Discord PC or mobile apps,â the blog said. The feature will launch over the next few weeks, âstarting with players in Japan/Asia, followed by Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally the Americas.â
Before you begin, make sure you have your console updated to the latest system software update and that your PlayStation Network and Discord are linked. (If you need instructions for how to update your console or link your account, you can find more details here.)  However once you ahve that set up, itâs pretty easy to join. All you need to do is select the Discord tab in the Game Base in the PS5 Control Center and then chose the Discord server or DM group you want to join. After that, pick your voice channel, and thatâs it. And if someone calls you, youâll get a PS5 notification right away.

Metallica is bringing its metal guitar â and a new PvP game mode â to Fortnite Festival,"James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo â the members who make up the world-famous band Metallica â are taking to the virtual stage. Starting Thursday, the band is headlining Fortnite Festival. Its arrival brings Metallica tracks that fans can play, specially-themed cosmetic items, and most notably, a new PvP mode in case you want to put your rhythm game chops to the test and compete against others. 
Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game available within Fortnite, has featured pop stars like The Weeknd and Lady Gaga in the past. Now, the theme will get a bit more metal. Epic Games announced six tracks that collect some of Metallicaâs popular hits. They are as follows: âEnter Sandman,â âFuel,â âMaster of Puppets,â âRide the Lightning,â âThe Unforgiven,â and âWherever I May Roam.â 
As usual, the new season will introduce a separate battle pass for Fortnite Festival where players can unlock a variety of cosmetic items for both the free and Premium Reward Track. The Premium track unlocks the Lars Ulrich Outfit right away, but youâll have to progress through the battle pass to unlock the other three band members. And if you really want to get into it, alternate âPuppet Masterâ versions of each bandmate will be purchasable in the Fortnite Shop for the duration of Season 4. You can view the full list of cosmetics available on the Fortnite blog.

Overwatch 2 bringing back highly coveted Pink Mercy skin for charity,"After years of requests from Overwatch fans, Blizzard is bringing back the Pink Mercy skin it released in 2018 as part of the âMercy for a Causeâ charity campaign with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. That skin raised $12.7 million in proceeds six years ago, during its two-week window of availability, and Overwatch players who missed out on it the first time have long begged for its return.
Later this month, Blizzard will make the Pink Mercy skin available for purchase once again in Overwatch 2. And just as it was in 2018, all purchase proceeds will be donated to support life-saving breast cancer research.
The original Pink Mercy skin will cost $15 â the same price it was sold for in 2018 â and will be joined by a new variant of that skin, Rose Gold Mercy, pictured above. The latter skin will be available in a bundle priced at $20. Those charity cosmetics will be available from June 25 to July 8.
The original âMercy for a Causeâ campaign led to the largest single donation ever made to BCRF, the organization said in a news release. Blizzard and the BCRF said in a news release they hope to repeat that success with the Pink Mercy skinâs relaunch.
âBlizzard is thrilled to be working alongside BCRF once again, bringing attention and funding to such an important cause,â said Johanna Faries, president of Blizzard Entertainment, in a statement. âOverwatch recently crossed the 100 million lifetime player milestone, and we hope that our amazing community will once again rally to help support the critical work of BCRF, all while showcasing these beautiful skins in-game.â 
âOverwatch launched one of the first charity partnerships in the gaming space with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation seven years agoâtheir innovation in the gaming industry mirrors the innovation BCRF is spurring in research to eradicate breast cancer,â said BCRF president and CEO Donna McKay in a statement. âThanks to the unprecedented funds raised by passionate gamers in 2018, we also launched the first initiative designed to pinpoint exactly how to prevent breast cancer in each individual personâwhat weâve dubbed The Precision Prevention Initiative (PPI). We are at a critical inflection point as incidence of breast cancer continues to rise and there is still more work to be done. We are thrilled to renew this collaboration to see how we can continue driving change, and saving lives, together.â 
Overwatch 2 is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. Blizzardâs hero shooter is free to play, and a recent update made all of the gameâs heroes unlockable for free.",https://www.polygon.com/24176406/overwatch-2-pink-mercy-skin-rerelease-blizzard-charity,2024-06-13 17:00:00
Donald Glover and Zack Foxâs animated comedy Yoppaman is completely bonkers,"On Wednesday, actor-comedian Zack Fox shared the first episode of Yoppaman, an animated comedy series about a dilapidated grits diner in the south, and itâs fuckinâ bonkers. The project was first teased back in April, when multi-hyphenate Donald Glover shared that he was working with Fox on an âanimeâ project during an episode of his Gilga radio live stream.
Clocking in at just over two and a half minutes, the first episode of Yoppaman centers on the eccentric employees of a Waffle House-inspired diner restaurant called Happy Grits. While beating up an unruly customer outside the diner, the group transforms into Power Rangers-style heroes to fight against the henchmen of a maniacal alien warlord who happens to be hovering in his ship above the restaurant. 
Itâs chaotic and weird and bursting with personality; the exact type of anarchic comedy thatâd feel right at home alongside the likes of Adult Swim staples Black Dynamite and Freaknik: The Musical.
A post shared by Chibu Okere (@chibuyum)
âIn 2022 I started developing an animated idea with my good friend and collaborator Chibu Okere,â Fox writes in the episodeâs YouTube description. âWeâre both Atlanta-raised artists who grew up on stuff like Devilman, FLCL, Evangelion, 90âs Cartoon Network, and of course black southern folklore/music/comedy/fashion etc. So we wanted to make something that synthesized all of that into a big gumbo pot. Yoppaman is the spawn of that synthesis.â
The resemblance is certainly striking. The design of characters and backgrounds feels like a combination of Hiroyuki Imaishiâs cult anime film Dead Leaves, TaiyÅ Matsumotoâs Tekkonkinkreet, and Ronald Wimberlyâs graphic novel GratNin. But even beyond those comparisons, Yoppaman feels like a passion project through and through and a creative breath of fresh air for fans of both anime and adult animation. 
The episode was produced by Six Point Harness, Inc, a Los Angeles-based studio that previously worked on the 2019 musical film Guava Island starring Donald Glover, with music written and performed by Devin Morrison. The showâs website hints that more episodes of the series will be coming out soon, with Fox and Okere looking to nurture the project âwithout the influence (or hindrance) of a networkâ before turning Yoppaman into a fully realized show.

"Teamfight Tactics turns 5, stepping out from Leagueâs shadow","There have been many game modes in League of Legends, and few of them survive long-term. A lucky few get entered into a rotation, showing up as short events for a bit of fun before being removed again. One game mode has been lucky enough to escape that fate; itâs now a stand-alone project thatâs stepped out from Leagueâs shadow. Teamfight Tactics turns 5, and the game mode continues to be one of Riotâs best bets so far.
Teamfight Tactics pits eight players against each other in a technically competitive but extremely chill battle. Players are offered units, which allow them to build basic teams that auto-battle it out â first against computer-controlled bots, and then against each other. As the matches progress, players have access to a shop and the occasional carousel of more units.
âTeamfight Tactics, when it launched as a game mode with a relatively small team, saw incredible reception from our players,â said Peter Whalen, game director for Teamfight Tactics, in a call with Polygon. âThere were so many people that tried out TFT and then continued to stick with it.â Today, Teamfight Tactics has a monthly player count of approximately 33 million â not as high as parent game League, but certainly a respectable fan base.
For a totally new player who isnât familiar with the genre or League itself, Teamfight Tactics can be confusing to pick up. Thereâs a high learning curve if you want to master all the intricacies, and if youâre not familiar with Leagueâs vast cast of characters, it can be hard to recognize the potential strengths of the characters assembled at the carousel  But there are a few key aspects of the game that are very easy to understand â if you get three of the same unit, it gets upgraded to tier 2. If you get nine units, that champion becomes tier 3, which makes them a game-changing presence in each battle. 
It doesnât take a lot of know-how to take advantage of that stuff, but doing it feels great â and the matches are short enough that a loss rarely feels bad. âThe game is structured so thereâs lots of little victories,â said Whalen. âThereâs lots of moments where you get a small win: You win a fight, youâve got a three-star champion, youâre getting the perfect items, the perfect Augment, something amazing happens on the carousel. And those feel really good.â
The Teamfight Tactics developers change up the gameâs roster and mechanics regularly with âsetsâ that rotate every four months. Each season has a specific theme. Dragonlands, for instance, has a host of dragon-related characters to pull from skins like Dragon Trainer Tristana, Dragon Guardian Galio, and Dragon Master Swain. Each new theme is an excuse to try a whole new set of mechanics built on the core gameâs foundation.
âEach season is a new puzzle to solve,â said Whalen. âIt really creates a novel and unique experience that has been one of the most successful things that weâve seen with our players. People have really latched on to solving the new puzzles that TFT presents.â
I personally played, and enjoyed, Teamfight Tactics at launch. I eventually wandered away, switching to Hearthstoneâs Battlegrounds mode for a bit before dropping my autobattler habit altogether. Years later, I absently clicked a Teamfight Tactics cinematic in my Twitter feed. It was so slickly produced that it was stunning, especially considering how goofy it was. 
League has been silly before, like the Pentakill music video where Mordekaiser punts Teemo, or if you want to go way back, the old-school Journal of Justice that shared in-universe articles written about the robot Blitzcrankâs dating service, or Veigar stealing a blimp at the Bandle City Fair. But Riot Games has also been building an entire multifaceted media ecosystem off the back of League of Legends, including Legends of Runeterra and 2XKO. Riot Forge, which was sadly shut down earlier this year, delivered a variety of indie games set in the world of League. The second season of Arcane is set to be released in November. Riot Games also has a whole music scene, debuting virtual bands like K/DA, True Damage, and Heartsteel. Teamfight Tactics is able to pull from all of that material and maintain its downright ridiculous tone â it can even add Arcane bad guy Silco, or a charming fellow like red fox brewmaster Kobuko.
Altogether, itâs a much friendlier and more welcoming environment than League of Legends, and itâs cultivated a community to match. The general vibe the team is going for is fanfiction, says Whalen. Silly little mascots like Choncc and Pengu are positioned around popular League characters, giving the vibe that when the League matches are over, the kayfabe drops and all the champions could be friends off set. Teamfight Tactics is able to liberally borrow from Leagueâs expanding library of content, and that has led to the one-time novelty game mode splitting off into a project that truly stands on its own under the Riot umbrella.

"Finally, 2024 is giving us a good imaginary-friends movie ","Imaginary friends are having a moment. This year has already seen Blumhouseâs Imaginary, a not-so-great movie about a murderous imaginary friend, and IF, an even-less-great movie about a whole world of imaginary friends, complete with a fairly toxic message about childlike wonder and fantasy. And now thereâs The Imaginary, the latest anime movie from Studio Ghibli successor Studio Ponoc, founded by Ghibli veteran Yoshiaki Nishimura shortly after Studio Ghibli announced its planned shutdown in 2014. Much like IF, The Imaginary centers on a world of lost imaginary friends, and on the relationship between a young girl and the friend she created. Unlike IF, though, it looks pretty terrific.
The Imaginary comes to Netflix on July 5 as part of an ongoing deal between Netflix and Ponoc. Based on a 2014 novel by British author A.F. Harrold, and directed by Ghibli animator Yoshiyuki Momose (Spirited Away, Porco Rosso, Whisper of the Heart), the movie follows Amanda and her imaginary friend Rudger, whose playful adventures through Amandaâs imagination are derailed by a predatory interloper. Hereâs Netflixâs description:
Studio Ponocâs The Imaginary portrays the depths of humanity and creativity through the eyes of young Amanda and her imaginary companion, Rudger. Their fantastical adventures, launched from her attic, lead them to discover a magical world of creatures and places never before seen until a sinister force threatens to destroy their imaginary world and the friendship within it. Directed by renowned animator Yoshiyuki Momose (Spirited Away), The Imaginary is an unforgettable adventure of love, loss, and the healing power of imagination.
This is Ponocâs first feature-length film since its debut, 2017âs Mary and the Witchâs Flower. Interim projects include the compilation movie Modest Heroes (featuring three short stories, one directed by Momose), and promotional material like the lovely 2021 Olympics short âTomorrowâs Leaves,â also directed by Momose.

Hot on the heels of a new trailer and a wave of coverage for Monster Hunter Wilds out of Summer Game Fest, Sony has announced that Wildsâ predecessor, Monster Hunter Rise, is coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog on June 18. Perfect timing, if youâre full of renewed excitement for hunting monsters and want to get your eye in ahead of the new gameâs 2025 release.
As a reminder, the Game Catalog is available to subscribers to the Extra and Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus.
Monster Hunter Rise was a Nintendo Switch-first release in 2021, with Windows PC, PlayStation and Xbox versions following over the next couple of years. Its Switch origins are evident â itâs hardly the most graphically rich game, and visually it pales a little next to its predecessor Monster Hunter World â but itâs still as deep and engrossing as these games get. Itâs on both PlayStation 4 and 5.
Elsewhere, Juneâs Game Catalog selections incline toward sports and strategy, with games in the Crusader Kings, Anno, Football Manager, and... Monster Energy Supercross series. For a break from all that tinkering and competing, try the beautiful abstract platformer After Us. Hereâs the full list of new additions, all coming on June 18.
Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers also get Kayak VR: Mirage for PlayStation VR 2, and Lego Star Wars 2, Ghosthunter, and Daxter for the Classic library.

Giant Helldivers 2 update buffs a ton of stratagems and weapons,"Arrowhead Game Studios issued a major update for its smash Starship Troopers simulator Helldivers 2 on Thursday, featuring sweeping balance changes, a more informative Galactic War map, and the addition of invite-only lobbies.
Patch 01.000.400 begins a change of pace at Arrowhead, which said earlier in the week that it planned to slow down the rate at which it updated the game, delivering bigger, higher-quality patches less frequently.
Itâs certainly a substantial update. There are some new features, but the headline for Helldivers 2 players is probably the huge set of balance changes that (mostly) buff stratagems and weapons across the game, with the goal of increasing viability and loadout variety.
In a very detailed blog post, Arrowheadâs chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt â evidently making good use of the time he freed up by resigning as the studioâs CEO â laid out the thinking behind the balance changes, going into some detail on each one. 
âWith these balance changes we wanted to buff up some of the weaker stratagems to make them more viable and add more opportunity for variety in loadouts,â Pilestedt said, adding that there were few nerfs in the patch. âWe also changed a few to make them more consistent, but the goal was to keep a similar or higher power level. We are looking into the stratagems more to see if there are any other stratagems that might need some buffs or changes to make them more viable.â
Some examples: Several of the gameâs sentry stratagems have been made more effective (and durable), the HMG emplacement and minefields have been buffed, and Orbital strikes are now more readily available and flexible in their use to make them competitive against Eagle stratagems. On the weapons side, at least eight of the gameâs firearms are buffed â including the grenade launcher, HMG, explosive crossbow, Adjudicator, and Tenderizer â and changes have been made to how Helldivers 2 handles recoil and rifle damage to durable body parts.
Away from balance changes, supply lines and attack origins were made visible on the Galactic War map to give players more information on the progress of the galactic conflict; the community will now be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, and potentially be able to stop it at its source. The option to create invite-only lobbies has been added â which anyone who plays in a set group of friends will surely welcome.
Super samples, an important resource in the game, now drop on difficulty level 6 (they previously only dropped at levels 7 and above). âWe feel that their existence only on difficulty 7+ forced some players to play the game on a harder difficulty than they wanted to comfortably play on. We do however still want a gating of them but a less punishing one,â Arrowhead said.

Introducing Supply Lines & Origin of Attacks
Supply lines were previously not shown on the Galactic War map to reduce clutter and improve readability. However based on the feedback from our community we have made an implementation showing them on the map. This solution tries to maintain the general readability while still exposing the system to players in game.
You will now also be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, potentially allowing for the community to stop the attack at its source. We have also updated visuals in the sector and planet info pop-ups.

Helldivers 2 poses the ultimate moral quandary in its new Major Order,"Helldivers 2 players just wrapped up a campaign against the Terminid threat, culminating in the destruction of Meridia. The super colony â and the ominous black hole it left behind â is probably going to lead to some further consequences. But while we wait for all of that to resolve, why not deal with a moral question about orphans, as a treat?
The newest Major Order is aptly called Operation Trolley Problem, a reference to a long-standing philosophical puzzle: do you let five die to the titular trolley via inaction, or pull a switch and kill one? Except this is the over-the-top world of Helldivers 2, so the question is: do you save a bunch of sick children from being totally annihilated by killer robots, or go get some cool anti-tank mines?
There are two planets that need liberation: Vernen Wells, host to Super Citizen Anneâs Hospital for Very Sick Children, or the MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines on Marfark. The in-game Major Order text reads: âOnly the first planet liberated is likely to be saved. The Helldivers are trusted to determine which course of action â rescuing the children, or the AT Mines â will ultimately save the most Freedom.â
At first glance, this might seem pretty bad! You might think that thereâs only one obvious ârightâ choice, and itâs saving the children. But have you considered that the Helldivers have been denied access to these mines twice now? One time, Helldivers had to choose between it and the Airburst Rocket Launcher, and we chose the latter. Another time, we had to scrap a minimum number of bots to get the mines â a goal that we missed.
Also, as one wise philosopher once asked â what if these kids have bad vibes? We didnât get to see or hear anything about their plight, besides it being a miracle that theyâre still alive. Right now, both planets are totally untouched by conquering Helldivers, so this Order could really go either way in terms of what players will decide. The game makes sure to set the parameters of our decision: we should try to do what has the most associated Freedom. Personally, Iâm itching to finally get my hands on those mines. But those kids could be very useful, considering that Super Earth has a pro-child labor policy. Truly, the latest Major Order offers much to think about.",https://www.polygon.com/24177223/helldivers-2-trolley-problem-major-order-sick-kids-tank-mines,2024-06-12 20:45:00
Sony buys Alamo Drafthouse theaters with an eye on bolstering Crunchyroll,"The Alamo Drafthouse chain of movie theaters has a new owner: Sony Pictures. The movie studio announced the purchase on Wednesday, with a press release detailing the deal, as well as the planned future for the chainâs existing theaters. 
According to Sonyâs press release, Drafthouseâs current CEO, Michael Kustermann, will remain in that position and be made head of a new division, Sony Pictures Experiences, while reporting to the president and COO of Sony Picture Entertainment, Ravi Ahuja. The theater will continue to operate all of its current 35 theaters across the United States. Alamo Drafthouse will also continue to run Fantastic Fest, its annual film festival based in Austin, Texas. 
Itâs no surprise that most of the announcements about the acquisition so far focus on how little Sony plans to change about the beloved theater chain, at least so far. The idea of a movie studio owning a chain of theaters still raises uneasy questions for a lot of theater-goers. The practice was illegal until 2020, when the Paramount Decrees were repealed. The decrees, put in place in 1948, were originally part of a set of antitrust rules designed to end the vertical integration of the movie business, where studios controlled every aspect of a filmâs life cycle, from production to theatrical distribution, which was often limited to studio-owned theaters. 
Even though the legal change happened four years ago, few production studios have taken advantage of the chance to purchase theaters of their own. Netflix and Disney have both put their names on historic theaters, keeping them open and screening a steady mix of their own films, as well as competitorsâ projects. But Sony is the first to make a play for a larger theater chain. 
This latest move from Sony also seems to tie into its 2021 purchase of Crunchyroll, the United Statesâ largest anime-focused streaming site. Sony has helped Crunchyroll become a major player in the theatrical exhibition space, especially for anime movies, like this yearâs Haikyuu!!: The Dumpster Battle. Increasing the box office impact of these anime movies has been a major goal of Sonyâs in recent years, and was the focus of the companyâs studio presentation at this yearâs CinemaCon. 
According to a quote from Ahuja in Sonyâs press release, the company sees the Alamo Drafthouseâs existing fans as pairing well with Crunchyrollâs offerings, suggesting that anime will play a large role in the theatrical chainâs future. Ahuja also notes that the kind of programming fans already enjoy at Alamo Drafthouses will continue, including movies from studios other than Sony.
âAlamo Drafthouseâs differentiated movie-going experience, admired brand and devoted community fit well with this vision. Our Crunchyroll business also aligns well with their audienceâs interests. We look forward to building upon the innovations that have made Alamo Drafthouse successful and will, of course, continue to welcome content from all studios and distributors.â

Zack Snyderâs Netflix animated series is full of Viking action and sword fights,"Zack Snyderâs long-in-development Viking series, Twilight of the Gods, finally has a trailer and a release date. The first look at the series is full of Viking violence, and plenty of blood, and the show is set to hit Netflix on Sept. 19. 
Twilight of the Gods follows Leif, who is saved from a battlefield death by Sigrid, a warrior who he later marries. However, on their wedding night, the pair are attacked by Thor, setting them on a journey through hell and across the many treacherous lands of Norse mythology. 
The trailer is a little lighter on those plot details, but it does have some pretty impressive action. The series is animated by French studio Xilam Animation (Chip ânâ Dale: Park Life), and looks reminiscent of shows like The Dragon Prince, with brief flashes of action from series like Samurai Jack. The characters look slick and unique, while the action itself looks beautiful, well-choreographed, and plenty bloody.
The series is co-created by Zack Snyder, Jay Oliva (Batman: The Dark Knight Returns), and Eric Carrasco (Foundation). Snyder directs the first and last episode, while Oliva, Andrew Tamandl (Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous), Tim Divar (Batman: The Killing Joke), and Dave Hartman (Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire) direct the rest.

Dorfromantik teamâs Star Birds splices Mario Galaxy with science YouTube,"Hereâs a union of two of my favorite German cultural exports: Dorfromantik, the exquisitely designed, minimalist landscape-building game, and Kurzgesagt â In A Nutshell, a YouTube channel that puts out tastefully animated, fascinating, and approachable explainers about the cosmos, biology, futurism, evolution, and other science-y topics.
Toukana Interactive, the developer of Dorfromantik, is collaborating with Kurzgesagt on Star Birds, a base-building and resource management game in which the channelâs cute, duck-like bird mascots explore space by hopping from asteroid to asteroid, mining, building, and creating automated production networks as they go.
The first thing that stands out about the game is its look, which uses Kurzgesagtâs house graphical style â bright colours, clean lines, and rounded contours â to render toylike, rotating asteroids reminiscent of the Super Mario Galaxy games.
Toukana laid out what to expect from the game on its Steam page and an accompanying post to Dorfromantikâs page. Players will use rovers to explore asteroids and uncover hidden resources; build mining and production facilities to research and manufacture new tech; fulfill quests set by the anarchic birds on their space station; establish trading routes and ultimately take off for new star systems. The asteroids are procedurally generated, and the key to the game will be using the 360-degree building system to make the most efficient use of each space rockâs limited surface area, connecting units with hand-drawn pipework. 
Toukana and Kurzgesagt also promise âa mysterious storyline featuring kurzgesagt vibes,â âresources & production processes inspired by real science,â and ârogue-lite elements & high replayability.â They warn that Space Birds is not a 4X game or a realistic physics simulation, however.
If Dorfromantik is anything to go by, Star Birds will be soothing, absorbing, and perfectly balanced. If Kurzgesagt is anything to by, it will be philosophical, surprising, curious, and a little bit epic, with dry narration. I canât wait. Star Birds is set for release in 2025.",https://www.polygon.com/24176851/star-birds-dorfromantik-kurzgesagt-announce-trailer,2024-06-12 15:39:01
Your Switch just left Twitter too,"It seems as though Nintendo, like everyone else, is finally fed up with toxicity, engagement farming, NSFW replies, and the utter randomness of the For You feed. The latest Nintendo Switch firmware update has removed all integration with X (formerly Twitter), Elon Muskâs social network.
As of June 10, you can no longer post screenshots to X from your Switch, or link your X and Nintendo Accounts. Nintendo also removed the ability send friend requests to friends and followers on all social media platforms. Just to prove itâs nothing personal against Elon, Nintendo hinted that image-sharing via Facebook may be removed âat a later date,â too.
If you want to share images from your Switchâs photo album on X, you now have to transfer them to another device first â either via USB connection to a PC, or wirelessly (using Nintendoâs quite clever QR code system) to a smart device.
Nintendo is actually the last platform holder to turn its back on X integration; Microsoft and Sony disabled the feature on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, respectively, last year. Itâs likely that the console makers have left X due to the exorbitant API fees imposed by Musk, which can result in companies paying over $40,000 per month for little-used features.
At time of writing, Nintendo had yet to post links to its Bluesky and Mastodon accounts on its profile page.",https://www.polygon.com/24176795/nintendo-switch-twitter-x-integration-ends,2024-06-12 13:01:46
Weâre finally getting details on Skate 4 â including custom socks and Tim Robinson,"The fourth game in EAâs cult skateboarding series â formerly known as Skate 4, now simply called Skate â is finally starting to come into focus, four years after it was announced... in a manner of speaking. Fittingly for a game which took an unusual route to becoming a reality, and which is quite a departure from its predecessors, EA is also tackling the marketing for the game a little bit differently.
Instead of a flashy trailer highlighting the new gameâs features, EA confused and delighted everyone by dropping a live-action sketch starring I Think You Should Leaveâs Tim Robinson into Fridayâs Sumer Game Fest stream. In the skit, Robinson plays Richie Dandle, an executive at M-Corp, the fictional corporation that previously owned and ran the city of San Vansterdam in which Skate is set. Robinson denies that M-Corp is leaving San Vansterdam while employees flee, cry, and shred documents behind him. (M-Corp is probably the new iteration of the tyrannical Mongocorp, which ran the city of San Vanelona in Skate 2. Yes, these skating games have lore.) Anyway, the videoâs pretty funny, you should watch it.
This is all great fun, and backed up by an official story so far blog post as well as a gloriously dated M-Corp website. But what about the, you know, game?
Fortunately, the developers at Full Circle, a remote-only game studio formed by EA specifically to make Skate, followed up the Robinson sketch by lifting the lid on the current state of the game in a blog post and accompanying development update video. Skate, as previously announced, will be a free-to-play, live-service skating MMO for PC and console. It doesnât have a release date yet.
Thereâs quite a lot of detail in the post and video, none of it all that surprising; Full Circle is iterating on the Skate seriesâ signature âflick-itâ control scheme using new physics and animation technologies, and going big on player customization. One of the most exciting tidbits is a âquick dropâ system that gives players the freedom to customise the city itself, adding rails to a balcony to enhance its trick potential. You can do this in multiplayer in real time, and then challenge other players to try out your creations: Throwdowns are a way to instantly challenge other skaters as they roam around the deserted city turned giant skate park.
Elsewhere, much is made of the fact that players will now be able to customize the color of their socks (Iâm guessing this is a top request among fans), and Full Circle promises that the game will constantly evolve over time, with new areas opening up, and new music being added to the soundtrack, too. The studio is actively appealing for new playtesters to help with development, and says it will be expanding from PC to console playtests later this year.
The Skate series seemed to have been consigned to history after Skate 3 came out in 2010. But, starting around 2014, that game found a surprise second life on YouTube, as creators exploited its wild ragdoll physics for comedy. In 2016, it was made playable on Xbox again. A fan campaign for a sequel built up steam and was finally rewarded by the announcement of Skate in 2020.
Skate may not be quite the game fans were expecting, and it remains to be seen whether EAâs decision to build it back as a free-to-play live-service game is a mercenary business move, or a smart way to serve this passionate audience. But Skate doesnât look like much else out there, and thatâs something.

You probably arenât ready to start Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree,"Elden Ringâs upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is less than two weeks from its June 21 release date â so if you want to play it immediately upon launch, youâll want to get to work now. Thatâs because there are some requirements to play Shadow of the Erdtree. You donât need to have completed the game, but you do need to have beaten two specific bosses to enter Shadow of the Erdtreeâs Shadow Realm: Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood.
âFriendly PSA for all those looking forward to #ELDENRING Shadow of the Erdtree,â publisher Bandai Namco posted to X. âYou have less than 2 weeks to prepare!â
Friendly PSA for all those looking forward to #ELDENRING Shadow of the Erdtree. You have less than 2 weeks to prepare! https://t.co/J18CrUkDQm
Donât fret if you arenât fully prepared; you can take comfort in the fact that there are plenty of people right there with you. Each of these bosses has an achievement tied to them: Shardbearer Radahn and Shardbearer Mohg, respectively. By tracking those achievements on each platform, we can see the percentage of people who are â and arenât â ready for Shadow of the Erdtree. Letâs break down the numbers.
Xbox players have a lot of catching up to do! There are likely a whole bunch of people who havenât beaten either boss, which makes the task even harder. But on average, 55% of players still need to beat Radahn, while an average of 68% of players still need to take on Mohg.
Of course, these numbers are likely a little skewed by people who bought the game but barely played it; on Steam, just 77.8% of people reached Elden Ringâs Roundtable Hold, which is basically the player hub. We can assume that the 22% of Steam players who stopped before reaching the Roundtable Hold probably wonât pick up Shadow of the Erdtree â or, maybe, itâll be their welcome back to the world.
Thereâs very little in Elden Ring thatâs easy, so if youâre looking for help in your Shadow of the Erdtree prep, head over to Polygonâs Starscourge Radahn and Mogh, Lord of Blood guides.",https://www.polygon.com/24176047/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-preparation-achievements-completed,2024-06-11 15:12:47
"Arcane to an end with season 2, and the trailer finds the cities in an all-out war","The second season of Arcane, due to arrive this November, will also be its final chapter. A new trailer from Netflix gives us a glimpse at what we can expect from season 2, and it appears like Zaun and Piltover are embroiled in active war.
At the end of Arcaneâs first season, Jinx fired her ultimate rocket into Piltoverâs council chambers. Fans were unsure about what this meant for the council, but based on this trailer, it sounds like the rocket successfully assassinated them. Melâs mother, Ambessa Medarda â set to join the roster of League of Legends champions in the future â is pushing for active aggression from Piltover, and both Caitlyn and Vi are suited up and running the Enforcersâ operations in Zaun to find Jinx, shut down Shimmer, and remove any remaining Silco loyalists. Based off the trailerâs colorful explosions, striking graffiti, and dramatic delivery, we can guess that Jinx wonât turn herself in peacefully.
We also see glimpses of Ekko, Heimerdinger, Sevika, and a few other characters â including a Yordle with prosthetic limbs that open up into deadly augmented multi-claws. These characters are all wildcards that could change the trajectory of the war, so itâll be interesting to see how these plot threads come together.
The trailer ends with a preview of a full-on fight between Vi and Jinx; the relationship between the sisters has been the core of Arcaneâs story. Weâll have to wait until November to see how, exactly, that dynamic unfolds â but it certainly looks like Silcoâs death, Jinxâs attack, and Ambessaâs influence have led to a much more dangerous and chaotic situation in both Piltover and Zaun.",https://www.polygon.com/24175597/arcane-season-2-trailer-jinx-vi-ambessa-ekko,2024-06-11 15:01:11
"âSexier, bloodierâ Snyder Cut of Rebel Moon movies to vie for attention in August","Zack Snyder spent years quietly hyping up his directorâs cut of Justice League and activating the #ReleasetheSnyderCut hive before Warner Bros., in need of content for its grand HBO Max experiment, threw him a few million to complete the job. The four-hour-long finished product was... definitely better than the 2017 theatrical version! This lent the director some credence that the Snyder Way should, in the future, be THE way. So maybe thereâs hope for Snyderâs two big August 2024 releases: Chapter One: Chalice of Blood and Chapter Two: Curse of Forgiveness â the expanded, uncut versions of his two Rebel Moon films.
Netflix announced on Tuesday that, starting Aug. 2, any willing participants would be able to âdelve further into the mythology and madness of Zack Snyderâs epic sci-fi saga in the viciously sexier, bloodier world of Rebel Moonâ when the two directorâs cuts simultaneously arrive to the platform. The new edits were always part of the plan; while Netflix still demanded two PG-13 movies from the filmmaker, Snyder negotiated two R-rated versions that would premiere at a later date â four movies for the price of two! During the release of the original first movie, Rebel Moon: Part One â A Child of Fire, Snyder told Polygon that the changes werenât just about blood and guts. âItâs almost like the story takes place in a slightly different dimension than this movie thatâs about to come out,â he said. 
The new titles illustrate that level of dramatic shift. You see, the first movies were parts and the new movies are chapters. Chalice of Blood ainât your grandpappyâs A Child of Fire, ya dig?
The notable difference between Snyderâs iterations on Justice League and his Rebel Moon saga is that the latter is all him. Whereas Snyder undid and expanded on the work of his cut-to-bits Justice League, a movie partially directed by Joss Whedon, everything Rebel Moon is the vision of Zack Snyder. He dreamt of a Star Wars movie, he stole from his own scrapped ideas to illustrate his new universe, and he even acted as both cinematographer and director to put the purest version of his ideas on screen. But the two PG-13 movies he delivered were completely uninspiring and drab, among the limpest work of his career. Can more Rebel Moon really save Rebel Moon? 
Weâll know by the end of the summer. Rebel Moon â Chapter One: Chalice of Blood and Rebel Moon â Chapter Two: Curse of Forgiveness arrive to Netflix on Aug. 2.",https://www.polygon.com/24176043/rebel-moon-snyder-cuts-r-rated-netflix-release-date,2024-06-11 14:29:48
Metal Gear Solid Delta hints at a future for the series,"Konamiâs remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater sounds like it will be the beginning of a series of new projects in the franchise created by a ânew team,â according to comments from producer Noriaki Okamura.
In a new video released Monday for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the name of Konamiâs upcoming MGS 3 remake, Okamura tells longtime Snake voice actor David Hayter that his team, which includes âplenty of people on the team who were part of the original games,â has âbeen entrusted with the future of Metal Gear.â
âWe want the players to be able to judge for themselves whether this new team is right for the job of keeping Metal Gear going,â Okamura said, referring to the teamâs work on Metal Gear Solid Delta and the recently released Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection compilation. 
In his discussion with Hayter, Okamura opaquely addressed the departure of former Metal Gear creatives, like Hideo Kojima and Yoji Shinkawa. While he does not explicitly name them, he says, âEveryone who is no longer working on Metal Gear is pursuing their own path now, and thatâs going to remain the case for these titles.â Thatâs a pretty solid indicator that Konami plans on (re)making more Metal Gear without the involvement of its original creator.
Okamura previously worked with Kojima and team on games like Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops and Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes. He was also a producer on the poorly received 2018 game Metal Gear Survive, the only original Metal Gear project released after Hideo Kojima left Konami. 
The Metal Gear Solid 3 remake could represent a fresh start for the franchise at a post-Kojima Konami. The 2024 game was selected to be lavishly remade in Unreal Engine 5 due to its place in the overall Metal Gear timeline, Konami told IGN last year; Snake Eater is an origin story for Naked Snake/Big Boss, and the first game chronologically in the franchise. In other words, itâs a smart place to start to bring in new fans who may not be well-versed in the MGS seriesâ era-jumping sequels.
If Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a success, and Konami does continue to remake games, Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker would be next in line chronologically. Those two early Cold War-era follow-ups to Snake Eater also star Big Boss â not Solid Snake â and would be able to build on the foundation of Metal Gear Solid Delta, using characters and assets from Metal Gear Solid Delta. 
When future Metal Gear remakes will come to pass is still unknown, as is the release date Metal Gear Solid Delta. The remake was originally pitched as a 2024 release, but Konami hasnât said anything this past week about Delta arriving this year, even as it sets pre-orders live. A 2025 release is starting to look more likely.
For now, Metal Gear fans will have to pass the time poring over new gameplay details released on Sunday in a new trailer for Metal Gear Solid Delta at the Xbox Games Showcase.",https://www.polygon.com/24175632/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-delta-konami-future-games,2024-06-10 21:47:24
Animal Crossingâs aquarium experience is going on tour â hereâs how it works,"Fans of Animal Crossing: New Horizons likely know the tedium and joy that comes with assembling an aquarium of their own and fishing season after season, but the fun doesnât have to stop in the game. Nintendo announced that the company will be bringing its Animal Crossing: New Horizons aquarium tour nationwide on Monday. The event started  with a partnership between Nintendo and the Seattle Aquarium that brought specially themed Animal Crossing exhibits to the aquarium. On Monday Nintendo announced that it would be expanding the event and tour several locations across the United States. 
The Animal Crossing: New Horizons Aquarium Tour will come to seven U.S. cities in total. It includes a nice spread of events across several regions. Here are all the locations and dates for each aquarium Nintendo has announced so far: 
The official FAQ on the event describes the tour as an âaquarium experience inspired by the Animal Crossing: New Horizons game.â The participating aquariums will host events âand more with an Animal Crossing twist.â However if you want to get a stronger idea of what the official Animal Crossing aquarium experience could actually be like, itâs helpful to look at the aquarium tour hosted at the Seattle Aquarium. 
A TikTok video from the user May showed what it was like to attend the event. The aquarium had giant Animal Crossing-themed backdrops to take photos. Visitors can look for cutouts of characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook in the aquarium, and get a card stamped as they find each character. Exhibits within the aquarium contain additional placards courtesy of Blathers, who will teach fans more about the fish they have caught in the game. Additionally, it looks like the event at the Seattle Aquarium contained adorable merch as well. If you want to see more, you can see the full video below. 
would you visit the animal crossing aquarium in real life? i had to go to seattle to support blathers #animalcrossing #acnh #animalcrossingnewhorizons #aquarium #nintendo 
Overall, it doesnât look like anything overly fancy, but it doesnât really need to be. The aquarium is already pretty dang fun â even without Tom Nook there â and it looks like the event could be the perfect excuse for an Animal Crossing fan to go and see some cool critters and fish.

A pair of World War champs are joining Microsoft Flight Simulator,"To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator recently launched its Famous Flyer 9 DLC, which adds two iconic pieces of aviation history. The $14.99 DLC currently available from the in-game marketplace adds the Douglas C-47 Skytrain and the Waco CG-4A glider. Sales of the DLC through July 5 will go to benefit the USO, a non-profit dedicated to serving US service members and their families throughout their enlistment in the armed forces.
Designed to ferry troops and supplies, these two unarmed aircraft were crucial to the success of the invasion of Europe during World War 2. The C-47 Skytrain, affectionately referred to as the âGooney Bird,â was the primary method of getting paratroopers into occupied France to disrupt enemy operations and open the way for the seaborne invasion of Normandy. Following World War 2, the C-47 continued operations supporting the Berlin Airlift and would remain in service with the U.S. Air Force through 1967.
The Waco CG-4A was used during World War 2 to stealthily land special operations units in occupied territory or supplement airborne operations that were limited by the number of available planes. The lightweight glider was towed to altitude by a C-47 or similar aircraft, decoupling ahead of the drop zone and making a controlled landing on a clear patch of terrain.
While not quite as exciting as its Ornithopter DLC, these two planes are an essential addition to the growing list of military and civilian aircraft available to fly in Microsoft Flight Simulator. If youâd like to try your hand at flying these second World War relics, the Famous Flyer 9 DLC is currently available to purchase from the in-game Microsoft Flight Simulator marketplace.

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake finally gets its release window,"Ubisoftâs remake for Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time has emerged from the shadows once again. After several delays and the development studio changing from Ubisoft Prune to Ubisoft Montreal, fans have finally gotten a release window for the remake at Ubisoft Forward on Monday. According to the showcase, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake is scheduled to release in 2026. 
The developers shared a brief visual teaser of the game showing a candle being relit after time rewinds. Other than that and the release year, the developers didnât share any new details. 
Ubisoft originally planned to release Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake in 2021. In spring 2023, a developer Q&A and FAQ shared the game was at the âconception phase.â However, developers assured players the game was âvery much alive,â but just in an âearly stage of development.â
Ubisoft released the original Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time in 2003 on Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Windows PC, and Xbox. It was developed by Ubisoft Montreal. Ubisoft released an original game in the series, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, in January 2024.",https://www.polygon.com/24175391/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-forward,2024-06-10 19:35:53
"Diablo 4 adds pets to the game, and theyâll pick up your gold and gems","The setting of Diablo 4 is a particularly grim one; as far as I can tell from my adventures through Sanctuary, everyone is eating boiled beets and waiting to be skinned alive by demons. Thereâs one thing that Blizzard is adding to the game thatâs downright adorable: pets. 
There are other benefits to pre-ordering, like a new mount, armor sets for each class, cosmetic wings, and so on â but forget all that, weâre here for the pets. The pets are actually downright adorable. You might expect animals in the world of Sanctuary to have blood-soaked jaws or vicious faces, but instead they look like adorable babies. Theyâre just fierce enough that you donât have to worry about them, but otherwise quite cuddly.
Pets will faithfully follow the player around, and they have a special utility in that theyâll pick up gold and items like herbs, ores, and crafting materials for you. Itâs nice to know that instead of having to run around everywhere, one of these pets will simply do it for you. Players who log in will receive an in-game request that unlocks pets, and upon completion, you can hang out with Asheara the canine. 
There are more pets that can be unlocked with a pre-purchase of Vessel of Hatred, the first expansion for Diablo 4. Players can pick between Alkor the Snow Leopard, Natalya the Tiger, and Hlrati the Canine. For those who donât want to pick between the three, the Ultimate Edition pre-order will grant all three pets.",https://www.polygon.com/24175495/diablo-4-pets-vessel-of-hatred-expansion-snow-leopard-tiger-husky,2024-06-10 18:17:00
Arcane hitting 4K Blu-ray for people who never want it to leave Netflix,"One way to ensure that a favorite show or movie never disappears from streaming rotation? Buy a physical copy. On Monday, the animation distributor GKIDS announced that fans of Netflixâs League of Legends series Arcane would soon have that chance, with Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray releases planned for later this year.
While Arcane carved out backstories for known League of Legends characters Vi and Jinx, the animated series triumphed on Netflix thanks to a tenuous connection to known lore and an emphasis on stylish action and dramatic character work. Produced by the French animation studio Fortiche for Riot Games, the series was a major hit for the streamer, clocking over 34 million hours of viewership in its first week. And based on Netflixâs recent report of 2023 stats, the series is still finding millions of viewers two years later as people wait and/or catch up ahead of Arcane season 2, due out in November. 
Details are light on what GKIDS might pack into a physical release, but the initial announcement promises âa full product array later this year, ranging from digital to premium editions, including a 4K version exclusive to the home entertainment release.â But in a rare tone for a Blu-ray licensing agreement, the folks at GKIDS seem over the moon to be making a physical edition of the series possible. The news broke out of the Annecy International Animation Festival, where where the distributor also acquired rights to Science Saruâs anime Dan Da Dan and a 4K restoration of Mamoru Oshiiâs masterpiece Angelâs Egg.
âWe are MONSTER fans of [Arcane],â said GKIDS founder and CEO Eric Beckman in a statement, âand our team is having a blast collaborating with the creatives at Riot and Fortiche to put together an amazing package for the fans. This project was dreamt up on the lawn by the lake at Annecy, so we are extra happy to be able to announce this collaboration at the festival and true home of animation.â
Thereâs no word on when Arcane season 1 will hit Blu-ray, but GKIDS promises more announcements to come later this year.",https://www.polygon.com/24175290/arcane-season-1-4k-blu-ray-physical-release,2024-06-10 15:27:09
"Upcoming city builder from Gone Home, Baldurâs Gate 3 devs flips the genre on its head","Steam is flooded with city builders right now (Iâm playing Fabledom, for instance), and most of them are relatively similar. Which is why, for me, the excitement of starting a new city builder comes in the form of new art styles, interesting combat mechanics, and compelling stories. But former Klei Entertainment developer Nels Andersonâs new company, Sonderlust Studios, is bringing novelty to the genre with its first game, Generation Exile, announced with a trailer on Sunday.
Generation Exile is a pretty city builder like any other, but this one has a distinctly anti-colonialist, environmentally sound aspect: Rather than bore into your new land for resources, ultimately destroying what it once was, Exile challenges players to use only the resources they had with them when they left their old world in the last-ever generation ship.  That includes water, food, and even air. Gameplay is turn-based and will include typical tasks of creating abodes and amenities, amassing resources, and keeping your residents content.
Over email, Anderson, who works as Sonderlustâs creative director, aptly explained to Polygon what the gameâs trying to do: Lots of city builders, he explained, are âfundamentally extractive and reward â if not demand â growing infinitely.â That means in order to continue in the game, you have to continuously bore into the earth, cut down trees, mine caves, etc. Generation Exile, on the other hand, pushes players to work in tandem with the new environment.
âRather than simply ânumber get biggerâ we wanted to make the problem-solving space more about seeking balance,â Anderson said. âRather than pulling more raw materials out of the ground for refinement, progress might instead look like developing a series of anaerobic lagoons that transform the biological waste (that must be stored and managed regardless) into nutrients for growing food or source crops for bioplastics.â
Time will move ultra-fast to account for several generations of your in-game society, which is comprised of procedurally-generated characters so no two games are the same. In fact, the generation of new maps and characters is a major part of how Sonderlustâs developers plan to accomplish that balance.
âWhile the player of course interacts with the map portion of the game from a familiar birds eye-ish viewpoint, they arenât some disembodied force of civic will or an otherwise nameless and uncharacterized overseer,â Anderson said. Instead, player characters will have reputations and bespoke interactions with NPCs âtriggered procedurally in reaction to the gameâs state and decisions the player has made.â
The premise is enough to pique my interest, but the lineup of devs and designers is even more impressive. Sonderlust is also calling in its chief operating officer, Karla Zimonja, co-creator of Gone Home, and some developers who worked on Baldurâs Gate 3 and Far Cry 5. As for sound design, Ben Prunty from Into the Breach will collaborate with the audio team from Celeste, Power Up Audio.
The early looks at the game are moody in a late-summer-afternoon type way, with an intriguing honeycomb city structure and lots of overgrown â50s-looking buildings. The UI also looks modern (and big enough to read, ahem) â a welcome change from your average city builder. 
âThe art style of Generation Exile was inspired in part by fauvism,â said Pier-Olivier Desbiens, 3D environment artist for Sonderlust Studios. âItâs a polygonal stab at the bold colors & flat strokes of the movement, with a heavy emphasis on simplifying shapes and objects so only the essential remains. The main goal was to create a world that feels familiar yet mysterious through the use of unusual, saturated color palettes.â
Generation Exile doesnât have a release date yet. When itâs released, itâll be available on Steam and other consoles to be announced. 
Correction (June 10): A previous version of this story misstated aspects of Generation Exile gameplay. The game will not include combat of any sort.",https://www.polygon.com/2024/6/9/24173143/generation-exile-announcement,2024-06-09 22:00:00
Gears of War: E-Day revealed in Xbox Showcase at Summer Game Fest,"Itâs been five years since Gears 5, the most recent mainline Gears of War game, and a lot of fans had been straight-up wondering if there was ever even going to be another Gears of War game. The Coalition, the Xbox Game Studios developer that makes Gears of War games, finally revealed a new game in the series called Gears of War: E-Day.
The moody cinematic trailer, which even includes a brief clip of Gary Julesâ âMad Worldâ cover that appeared in an old, iconic trailer for the first Gears of War, depicts two Gears soldiers fighting Locust enemies. It looks like this gameâs story will be a prequel to the first Gears of War game, as one of the two Gears is wearing Marcus Fenixâs headwrap and looks like heâs a young version of the famous character who starred in the original trilogy of Gears of War games (and still appears as an older advisory character in the latter-day Gears games). The other Gears soldier appears to be a young version of Dom, Marcusâ BFF from the original games. The gameâs âE-Dayâ title, which refers to the original day that the Locust showed up, further cements the prequel idea and tells us exactly when this game is happening.
The first three Gears of War games, all made by Epic Games, were an exclusive staple of the Xbox lineup in the late 2000s and 2010s. The games popularized the cover shooter genre as well as âhorde mode,â a survival mode in which players face endless waves of enemies and try to stay alive as long as they can. Gears games werenât the first to do either of these types of gameplay, but they are still perhaps the most popular examples of both. After the release of the initial trilogy, though, a few things changed. The gamesâ lead designer Cliff Bleszinski left Epic Games in 2012, and in 2014, the Gears of War license was acquired by Xbox Game Studios. 
Most fans (including this author) agree that the very first Gears game post-acquisition, Gears of War 4, was a rocky transition and didnât âfeelâ quite like a Gears game, tone-wise. Gears 5 managed to recapture a lot of the magic of the originals while also introducing some new stuff (like open world sections, which are weird for a Gears game but not un-fun). Itâs very interesting to see the Coalition returning to E-Day and clearly trying to evoke the feel and the look of the original Gears of War trilogy.
As for how the Coalition has spent its time since developing Gears 5, it definitely wasnât just an immediate dive into Gears of War: E-Day. Instead, the studio made Gears Tactics (2020), a turn-based strategy game set in the Gears universe; and The Coalition was also tapped to help in the development of Halo Infinite. If there were ever going to be an announcement of a Gears of War game in 2024, fans would have expected it to be Gears 6, a straight-up sequel to Gears 5, so this announcement comes as a surprise all around.

"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 revealed, arrives this October","Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be released on Oct. 25, Activision and developers Treyarch and Raven Software confirmed Sunday during Microsoftâs Xbox Game Showcase and Call of Duty Direct. This yearâs Call of Duty promises to deliver âthe most breathtaking and spectacular Black Ops action to date,â Activision says, with an increasing scope that will span a globetrotting campaign, robust multiplayer offerings, and the return of round-based Zombies gameplay.
As previously announced, Black Ops 6 will be set in the aftermath of the Cold War era, in the early 1990s. The gameâs campaign will be an âepic spy thriller,â Activision said in a news release, that blends stealth-based gameplay with blockbuster action in locations across Russia, the Middle East, southern Europe, and the United States. Black Ops series mainstays Frank Woods and Russell Adler will be joined by newcomers, including Troy Marshall and Jane Harrow, in the narrative.
In the first screenshots released for Black Ops 6, we get a tease of some of that action and a look at the franchiseâs new characters. We also get to see Adler do a sick motorcycle jump off of a cop car in what appears to be Washington, D.C. under siege.
Hereâs what else we know about this yearâs Call of Duty:
Activision promises a new, refined movement model called Omnimovement, which the company says will let players âmove realistically and seamlessly chain movements like a real action hero.â Omnimovement will let players sprint, slide, and dive in any direction, and new Supine Prone positioning will let them rotate while prone. Black Ops 6 will also include other new movement options, including âcorner slicingâ abilities, âwhere as you round a corner or go through a doorway, your weapon is going to dynamically rotate in the direction that youâre rounding that corner.â
Treyarch promises 16 new maps when Black Ops 6 launches, including 12 core 6v6 maps and four Strike maps that can be played as 2v2 or 6v6â¯. Black Ops 6 will also see the return of Classic Prestige, with âalways something to progress toward.â
Black Ops 6 will also include HUD presets, which will let players move the minimap and remove HUD elements for a minimalist interface.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will see the return of round-based Zombies mode, in which players battle increasingly difficult waves of undead enemies. Treyarch promises two new maps at launch with Liberty Falls and Terminus, and all the associated secrets that Zombies players have come to expect over the past 15 years.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on Oct. 25, on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Battle.net, Microsoft Store, and Steam), Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The gameâs open beta will be available on all platforms. 
Game Pass subscribers will get access to Black Ops 6 day one. On Xbox, subscribers will get access to the Digital Cross-Gen Bundle (for Xbox One and Series X), while PC Game Pass subscribers will get access to the standard edition of the game. Game Pass subscribers will also get the Woods Operator Pack and open beta early access pre-order benefits.

Fallout 76 will finally let sickos play as Ghouls in early 2025,"Fallout 76 has updated consistently since its launch, and Bethesda has experimented with different ways to expand the base game. This has included Expeditions, which take us to places like The Pitt or Atlantic City, as well as new dungeons hidden in abandoned Vaults or underground environments. At todayâs Xbox Games Showcase, we learned more about the upcoming Skyline Valley update â and for the first time, fans can actually play as Ghouls.
The Skyline Valley is a new southern region of Appalachia, nestled between the Ash Heap and the Cranberry Bog. This is the first time weâve seen a major update to the Appalachian map, and looking up at the sky, it seems like something has gone wrong in some terrible way. The Skyline Valley update is currently available for testing on Fallout 76 test realms, and it is set to release on June 12.
The new trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase showed off more of Skyline Valley, but also revealed that in early 2025, fans will have the ability to play as a Ghoul character, which is exciting â especially after the Amazon show got everyone fired up about Walton Gogginâs Ghoul. Ghouls are Wastelanders who absorbed enough radiation to mutate themselves, but not enough to die; they look significantly more haggard than their human counterparts, but are much more resilient and they live longer. They can also go feral, which turns them into maddened beasts â so itâs really a mixed bag.
Itâs fascinating to see how Fallout 76 is continuing to adapt and evolve after its notoriously rocky launch. This is the first Fallout game that is brave enough to let players actually be a Ghoul, and I canât wait to see how that new archetype changes the rest of the game.",https://www.polygon.com/24174836/fallout-76-xbox-games-showcase-skyline-valley-update-playable-ghouls,2024-06-09 17:56:21
Diablo 4âs Vessel of Hatred expansion release date announced at Xbox showcase,"The first expansion for Diablo 4, Vessel of Hatred will be released on Oct. 8, 2024. Blizzard first revealed the upcoming expansion at the Xbox Games Showcase. Blizzard announced the expansion back at BlizzCon 2023, where we learned it would include a new region, new class, seasonal play, and more. 
The opening cinematic for the game teased a devious scenario where a floating crystal talks to a character named Neyrelle, who is on a quest to reach Akaratâs Tomb. However, all is not well with the adventurer. The short clip shows her being infected by the stone and ends up trapping her in a very fleshy cavern at the center of a giant demon. 
According to a press release distributed after the trailer debut, the new Diablo 4 class is the Spiritborn, an entirely new class that has yet to show up in any prior Diablo title. The Spiritborn are deeply tied to the jungles of Nahantu, using the Spirits within the ancient civilization to bolster their own martial power. Weâll learn more about the Spiritborn during a reveal on July 18, where Blizzard will give players an in-depth look at this new class and its capabilities.
The story of Vessel of Hatred picks up after the end of Diablo 4 and takes us to a new region in the south of Sanctuary known as Nahantu, or Torajan to outsiders. This landmass is thick with jungle, but still as dark and ominous as the rest of the regions players have seen so far. Players havenât seen this region of the world since Diablo 2. If you havenât completed the main campaign, Vessel of Hatred will start with a recap and then let you play on from there.

Perfect Dark comes out of hiding in spy-action-packed first gameplay trailer,"Microsoft revealed a long look at its ambitious, long-in-development reboot of the Perfect Dark franchise on Sunday at the Xbox Games Showcase, revealing the first gameplay from secret agent Joanna Darkâs all-new adventure. 
The new Perfect Dark will focus on âa near-future war over advanced tech that threatens the lives of millions,â said Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. As Dark, players will need to use stealth, parkour, high-tech gadgetry, and good old-fashioned firearms to fend off global disaster.
Perfect Dark will feature elements of first-person shooters, immersive sims, and stealth-action, according to a post on Microsoftâs Xbox Wire. Players will be presented with an objective and varied tools and options to figure out how to achieve it, developers say. Joanna can go in loud with guns blazing, or quietly, with stealth techniques to take down enemies and complete missions. Parkour is used for both movement through levels and in combat. She can also use special spy technology, including a voice analyzer that can create deepfake voice imprints, letting players bypass security systems or impersonate other characters.
Hereâs how developers explained the setting of the new Perfect Dark, which is set against a sci-fi ecological disaster:
Perfect Darkâs near-future world has been impacted by whatâs known as âThe Cascade,â in which the planet has suffered from a series of environmental disasters, rendering entire regions inhospitable to human life. In the wake of the disaster, a hypercorporation known as Core Mantis steps in to create a solution known as The GEN Network, and deploys it in Cairo â restoring ecological balance and creating a freshly walled city, insulated from the hostile environment outside to become a center for technological innovation.
Perfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics for Xbox Series X and Windows PC. The game does not have an announced release date. The new Perfect Dark, and its core development studio, The Initiative, were revealed in 2020.

State of Decay 3 emerges with a new trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase,"State of Decay 3 was first revealed in 2020, with a brief teaser trailer showing a survivor hunting an infected animal in a winter environment. The game went back underground after that, and Undead Labs focused on regular updates and experimental patches for State of Decay 2. At Sundayâs Xbox Games Showcase, we got to see a new trailer for State of Decay 3, and it shows a much larger look at the various heroes and zombies weâll encounter.
The State of Decay franchise is zombie survival games where the player has to build up a base, manage resources, secure fortifications, and reach out to other groups. Much of the gameplay in State of Decay 2 is procedurally generated; the survivors who join your settlement arrive with their own past, pet peeves, and complications. Itâs up to the player to roll with the punches and survive regardless â although that usually requires some of the playerâs existing characters to perish dramatically.
It looks like the State of Decay 3 trailer has leaned into this angle heavily, showing a heroic sacrifice and a shrine made up of curious trinkets and keepsakes left behind. The trailer also showed a healthy amount of combat, with survivors warding off the undead through the power of firearms and teamwork.
Thereâs still no release date for State of Decay 3, but after a barebones teaser trailer and then years of silence, itâs good to see the project re-emerge. ",https://www.polygon.com/24174830/state-of-decay-3-xbox-games-showcase-2024-trailer,2024-06-09 17:37:24
Blizzard announces The War Within release date ,"The next expansion for World of Warcraft will be the first in a three-part arc known as the Worldsoul Saga, and we now know when it will release. At the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft-owned Blizzard Entertainment announced that The War Within will be available on PC on Aug. 26.
We first learned about the Worldsoul Saga, along with the follow-up expansions Midnight and The Last Titan, at BlizzCon 2023. With no BlizzCon planned for 2024, it makes sense that Blizzard would share the release date at the Xbox Showcase event. The War Within is already in beta testing, and players are poring over the content already available.
In The War Within, players finally tackle the issue of the giant sword that pierced the deserts of Silithus, left behind by the jailed Titan Sargeras. The world of Azeroth has been struggling with that great wound for years now. In the Battle for Azeroth expansion, both factions ended up warring over a new resource called Azerite, which began pouring forth from the land after that great sword strike. While the Shadowlands and Dragonflight expansions ended up getting sidetracked along other stories, it looks like weâre returning back to that plot in a big way.
The War Within includes Warbands, a cross-character progression system that allows players to benefit without having to split effort across alts, and quick dungeon runs called Delves which offer solo play sessions with intriguing rewards. We can expect to tour through Azerothâs previously unexplored underground areas, like the ancient Nerubian kingdom, and the home of the Earthen â who will be joining both the Horde and Alliance as the next character race.

"Dragon Age: The Veilguard is coming this fall, watch the first trailer","At Sundayâs Xbox Games Showcase, BioWare premiered a new trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard (formerly Dreadwolf), featuring something that fans of the storied role-playing game franchise have awaited for a decade: a release window. Dragon Age: The Veilguard will officially launch sometime this fall, on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.
The new trailer for the fourth mainline Dragon Age game was more of a tone-setter, introducing players to the adventurers theyâll fight alongside in The Veilguard. Those allies include:
BioWare promises those seven companions will have rich lives and deep backstories, and that you can befriend them, and even fall in love with them, over the course of the single-player narrative. Expect to learn more about Dragon Age: The Veilguardâs companions and how theyâll play during a gameplay reveal livestream on June 11.
Little has been revealed about the follow-up to Polygonâs 2014 game of the year up to this point, other than that it will be set in several nations previously unexplored in a core Dragon Age game, and that it will continue the story of Solas, a rogue mage and companion character from Inquisition who inspired the legendary figure of the Dread Wolf and wants to tear reality apart. 
However, BioWare shared in blog post last week, those behind the game felt like naming the game after the Dread Wolf felt a little off. âNaturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions â not your enemies â are the heart of this new experience.â 
Dragon Age games are known for their rich companion characters, and The Veilguard boasts a collection of seven, with âdeep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them â as well as their lives.â 
Itâs been a long and rocky road for The Veilguard, especially of late, with layoffs at BioWare, including all members of Canadaâs first games industry union in 2023, former employees suing for inadequate severance, and in general a high level of turnover among veteran Dragon Age staff and writers, including creative director Mike Laidlaw in 2017, producer Mark Darrah in 2020 (though he later returned as a consultant), and writer Mary Kirby in 2023. 
Only time will tell if The Veilguard can once again reach the heights of its predecessors. But now we know when that time is.",https://www.polygon.com/24167121/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-release-date-trailer,2024-06-09 17:26:31
"Nine months later, we finally have a launch date for Starfieldâs Shattered Space DLC","Bethesda has finally revealed the launch date for Starfieldâs Shattered Space DLC at Summer Game Fest. The inaugural piece of DLC for Bethesdaâs latest open-world RPG, to be released in 2024, will introduce a new quest line centered around a mysterious Great Serpant in addition to a robust helping of new ship parts, weapons, and quality-of-life improvements. Shattered Space was announced prior to Starfieldâs launch, and was sold as part of the $99.99 Premium Edition of the game players purchased around nine months ago.
The team announced new changes heading to the game on Sunday that will introduce new locations, gear, and bounties to the game. Starfield has enjoyed a myriad of changes and improvements from its dedicated modding community, but this DLC represents the most substantial official changes to Starfield since its launch back in September. Bethesdaâs post-launch support for the game has been limited to a handful of updates, which have largely focused on addressing bugs and performance issues.
While a new storyline is always a welcome addition, personally, Iâm more excited about the new customization options Shattered Space is promising, so I can build even crazier ships and settlements.",https://www.polygon.com/24172975/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-launch-date-announcement-summer-game-fest,2024-06-09 17:23:27
Doom: The Dark Ages takes hell back to medieval times,"Announced during Microsoftâs Xbox Games Showcase, Doom: The Dark Ages is id Softwareâs next foray back into hell. Doom: The Dark Ages is a medieval spin on the Doom franchise, taking the Doom Slayer back to the beginning. Itâs coming to Xbox Series X (including Xbox Game Pass on day one) sometime in 2025, and it will also be available on PlayStation 5 and Windows PC.
The first trailer for Doom: The Dark Ages shows the frenetic, precision gameplay weâve come to expect from the franchise â thereâs a lot of blasting and shooting and a chainsaw. Oh, and the Doom Slayer can ride a dragon?

Sundayâs announcement is the first official news of Doom: The Dark Ages, following an Insider Gaming report from May. Bethesda Softworks and id Software released Doom Eternal in 2020. Launching alongside Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Doom Eternal was a major hit. The game sold three million digital copies in its release month, according to sales numbers from Superdata. Thatâs three times the number of copies 2016âs Doom sold in its first month, per GamesIndustry.biz. id Software released two pieces of DLC for Doom Eternal: The Ancient Gods: Part One and The Ancient Gods: Part Two.
In 2021, ahead of The Ancient Gods: Part Two, Doom Eternal game director Hugo Martin spoke to Polygon about the future of the series â perhaps hinting at the medieval setting: âCould we tell a story about when [the Doom Slayer] first came to that place with the Sentinels, almost like a more medieval setting, a fantasy setting?â Martin said. âI think as you play the DLC, too, youâll see lots of hints of what we could do moving forward. Maybe even in the future. Again, our hero is somewhat timeless â I mean, literally, heâs immortal. So we could tell all kinds of stories.â
Update: Weâve edited this article to clarify that Doom: The Dark Ages is coming to PlayStation 5 and Windows PC as well as Xbox Series X.",https://www.polygon.com/24171213/doom-dark-ages-microsoft-xbox-games-showcase-sequel,2024-06-09 17:13:18
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 release date leaked by Xbox store,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be released on Oct. 25, according to its Xbox store listing. Microsoftâs very own Xbox store seemingly leaked the release date ahead of the Xbox Games Showcase, in which Activision will detail the upcoming game in its own showcase. The companyâs already confirmed that Black Ops 6 will come to Game Pass on its launch day in October.
The $69.99 version up for pre-order on the Xbox store will include access to an open beta period, as well as extra skins. Itâs also a cross-generation bundle, meaning it includes versions for Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
Black Ops 6 is developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, and set in the â90s â Activision describes it as a âspy action thrillerâ in an era âcharacterized by the end of the Cold War and the rise of the United States as a single superpower,â according to the store listing. Naturally, Black Ops 6 will launch with a multiplayer mode that has 16 maps and its popular zombies mode, which lets players take on hordes of the undead.

Look! 4 games surprise launch at Wholesome Direct,"Saturdayâs Wholesome Direct showcased dozens of (yes, wholesome) games, including four that surprise launched alongside the event. Four whole games! Those games are Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, POOOOL, The Palace on the Hill, and Tracks of Thought. All are available on Windows PC Steam, but youâll also find Kamaeru on itch.io and Nintendo Switch; The Palace on the Hill on Android, Apple iOS, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X; and Tracks of Thought on Windows PC via the Epic Games Store.
Kamaera is basically a frog farming simulator, where youâre essentially setting up a habitat for your frogs to thrive, while POOOOL is a physics puzzle game that sounds like a twisted Suika Game. Meanwhile, The Palace on the Hill is a slice-of-life game about life in rural India in the â90s and Tracks of Thought is a card-based mystery solving ride. They all couldnât be more different, but each looks delightfully wholesome all the same.
Beyond the four surprise released games, the Wholesome Direct was not short on games to get excited for. Some that Iâm looking forward to include Squeakross: Home Squeak Home, which is mouse Picross; ÃtÃ©, a watercolor painting simulator; Sopa: Tale of the Stolen Potato, an adventure game about getting a potato for your grandmaâs soup; While Waiting, a silly game that makes you wait around; Tiny Bookshop, which has a new demo available; and Wax Heads, where you run a record store.
There were too many incredible looking games shown during the Wholesome Direct to list here, so if you missed the show, Iâd recommend watching it for yourself.

Reality dating game The Crush House to be everything Iâve ever wanted in August,"The Crush House has everything: romance, drama, a Malibu mansion, and... a dark mystery. Behind the bubbly, colorful facade, The Crush House seems to have something lurking under the surface, something âworse than death,â according to a news release â the showâs  cancellation. Reigns developer Nerial announced Friday that The Crush House will launch on Windows PC on Aug. 9.
As Iâm sure you can tell, The Crush House is sort of like a playable version of Love Island or The Bachelor, set in a Malibu mansion in 1999. You play as the showâs producer, tasked with filming the castâs shenanigans. But itâs not as easy as just pointing the camera and running with whatever happens â youâll have to put people together to create that romance and drama to keep up with the audiences needs.
At night, youâll explore the titular house and begin to uncover the darker side of the show. Hereâs how Nerial described it:
But thereâs more to The Crush House than meets the eye, and a sinister mystery is waiting to be uncovered. Jae can explore the mansion at night when the show goes off-air, engaging in forbidden conversations with the cast to figure out the many dark and twisted secrets of The Crush House.
Iâve never wanted anything more. The Crush House is out Aug. 9 on Windows PC, but thereâs a Steam demo available now.",https://www.polygon.com/24171361/the-crush-house-nerial-reality-dating-devolver-digital-release-date,2024-06-08 00:30:00
Cult of the Lamb is getting multiplayer co-op â and a goat,"Itâs Cult of the Lamb, but make it goat. Thatâs right, developer Massive Monster is adding two-player multiplayer co-operative play to Cult of the Lamb â with a goat. Announced Friday during Devolver Digitalâs Devolver Direct, the free update, called Unholy Alliance, will be released on Aug. 12.
In the update, the Lamb and the Goat will be able to complete the entire Cult of the Lamb campaign in local co-op. Massive Monster said in a news release that Cult of the Lambâs fishing and dice game, knucklebones, will have a two-player twist, too. The Lamb and the Goat will be able to âswap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, or deal a critical hit if their attacks are in sync,â according to the press release. But itâs not only about co-op: Solo players will have a few new powers and abilities to try out â on top of ânew tarot cards, relics, buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and other secrets to discover.â
Massive Monster and Devolver Digital released Cult of the Lamb in 2022, and it was a major hit. Since then, Massive Monster has released two free updates: the notorious âsex updateâ Sins of the Flesh and a combat-focused expansion called Relics of the Old Faith.

Like 2016âs Hyper Light Drifter and 2021âs Solar Ash, the upcoming Possessor(s) is a fast-paced, stylish game that looks like it stays true to Heart Machineâs core ethos.
Heart Machine describes Possessor(s) as a âfast-paced action side scroller with combat inspired by platform fighters, a story told through dangerous characters, set in a deep interconnected world ripe for exploration.â Youâll play as two different characters â Luca, the host, and Rehm, her âless-than-cooperative counterpartâ â as they learn to coexist and survive the âinterdimensional catastrophe,â according to the press release.

Palworldâs first major expansion adds Pals and a whole new island,"Pocketpair, the developer behind surprise survival hit Palworld, announced the first expansion at Summer Games Fest 2024. The new update will include a new island, Sakurajima, which includes a Japanese-style shrine, a mushroom-laden swamp, and a scary graveyard. Thereâll also be new Pals, new Pal subspecies, a new faction and leader, and more.
The update will have a major building overhaul, which is good news for those of us who liked building strongholds and palaces for our Pals. Several building restrictions have been removed; players have a higher maximum number of bases; and new structures like pillars, glass structures, and work stations will be available.
Once players have found their feet and conquered the new content, theyâll want to look to the new Stronghold, a massive oil rig that is defended by a poacher group. Players can engage in large-scale battles, fighting for rewards like the new resource Crude Oil. The update also includes a PvP Arena mode, where players can pit their Pals against each other. Palworldâs update will include Xbox-dedicated servers to help console players tackle the gameâs island with friends.
Palworldâs Sakurajima update is set to release on June 27, 2024; the game first came out in January. When the game was first released, it had a startling hot streak of sales. However, player enthusiasm waned as the weeks went on.

Among Us developer Innersloth now funding a bunch of indies,"Among Us was released in 2018, but it was in 2020 that the game absolutely blew up. The social deduction game bloomed from a simple concept with a single map into a worldwide phenomena that amassed more than half a billion monthly active players in November 2020, according to defunct research group SuperData. Among Us is free to play on mobile and $5 on consoles, but add in its wearables and youâve got a ton of money to work with. Developer InnerSloth announced Friday at Summer Game Fest that itâs using that money to create an indie fund called Outersloth.
âItâs no secret the games industry has been through a lot of turmoil with layoffs and a lack of funding,â the developer said in a news release. âInnersloth is incredibly lucky to have been able to find success and stay truly independent: no investors, no publishers, no acquisitions. This is all thanks to the support of players and industry friends.â
So far, Outersloth has funded nine games. Hereâs how Outersloth describes them:
- Battle Suit Aces, Trinket Studio â From the creators of Battlechef Brigade, this card-battling RPG lets you captain your own epic tale in upgradable mecha Battle Suits. 
- Project Dosa, Outerloop Studio â From the creators of Thirsty Suitors, discover and cook new dosa recipes, help the locals, and fight off enemies in your mech to reunite with your loved ones.
- Mossfield Archives, Studio Any Percent â A relaxing and beautiful game about exploring and building connections. 
- Rogue Eclipse, HUSKRAFTS â A roguelike spacefighter for the new age. Master your aerial skills and soar through a galaxy inspired by Arab Futurism.
- ONE BTN BOSSES, Midnight Munchies â Itâs in the name. Push, tap, and bash your way through galactic bosses and upgrade your ship. 
- Mars First Logistics, Shape Shop â Build physically simulated rovers and transport awkwardly shaped cargo across the surface of Mars. 
Outersloth is also funding new games from Venba studio Visai Games; El Paso, Elsewhere developer Strange Scaffold; and a new studio called Coldblood Inc, which is founded by a Celeste developer and game engine Murder creator. Led by Among Us CEO Forest Willard and communications director Victoria Tran, Outersloth isnât a publisher: âWe want to fund your game,â Outersloth wrote on its website. âWe donât want to publish your game. We donât want your IP. We just want to see fun, original, and clever games get made. And we want to make that as friendly as possible.â 
The funding model is ârecoup and reshare,â according to the Outersloth website â meaning that itâll recoup its investment and then share revenue. Outersloth is looking to fund games with a budget between $50,000 to $2 million. 
Given the state of the industry â studios closing, layoffs, and a major lack of funding â Outersloth couldnât have been announced at a better time. ",https://www.polygon.com/24174029/among-us-innersloth-outersloth-funding-initiative,2024-06-07 22:45:58
Dune: Awakening story teased in new cinematic trailer,"Itâs been about a year and a half since we first caught wind of Dune: Awakening, the massively multiplayer online survival game set on the planet of Arrakis. On Friday, Funcom released a story-focused trailer at Summer Game Fest, teasing that the game will focus on an alternate telling of the story of Paul Atreides â but weâll have to wait until Gamescom in Aug. 2024 for a gameplay trailer.
The game drops players first-person into the world of Dune (well, at least, the world of Arrakis) where theyâll traverse the desert, using the land and relying on its other inhabitants to survive and thrive. Players will be able to join house Atreides or the Harkonnen, or live a quieter existence as a crafter or trader â but they wonât be able to kill or ride sandworms, unfortunately.
The game harnesses the simultaneously desolate and claustrophobic setting of the desert to push players to their survival game limits: Youâll have to avoid the sun, evade sandworms, craft tools, and find water wherever it exists (and yes, that includes enemiesâ bodies). But itâs not all treacherous walks through Arrakis â vehicles include thopters, thumpers, and sand bikes, and the Voice is at your disposal should you need to sway your enemies one way or another.
While past Dune games have (very successfully, mind you) leaned on real-time strategy to encapsulate the vibe of the books and films, Dune: Awakening promises the most immersive experience yet. Weâll have to see if it delivers on that promise when itâs released on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.

Blumhouse Games shows off six horror titles at Summer Game Fest,"Blumhouse Productions is the studio behind many modern horror films, from Paranormal Activity and The Purge to Get Out and Five Night at Freddyâs. Now, the business is expanding with Blumhouse Games, a game publishing arm. Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse, was at Summer Game Fest Friday to announce a slate of six horror games that will release under Blumhouse. These games were chosen to be strange, experimental, and deeply weird, and cover a range of art styles, genres, and methods of presentation.
The six games revealed in the Summer Game Fest trailer include:
Crisol: Theater of Idols from Vemila: A first-person adventure set on the unholy island of Tormentosa, where protagonist Gabriel must use his sanguinomancer powers in order to explore and survive.
Grave Seasons from Perfect Garbage: A Stardew Valley-esque farming sim thatâs perfect for cozy gaming... as long as youâre willing to put up with the occasional murder and slow burn mystery.
Sleep Awake from Eyes Out: A surreal first-person game that takes place in the distant future, following a girl named Katja as she struggles against dangerous enemies and her own self.
Fear the Spotlight from Cozy Game Pals: An old-school survival horror game that is heavily inspired by the PlayStation 1 era, where the protagonist must solve the mystery of her local high school while avoiding the scorching daze of the deadly spotlight.
The Simulation from PlayMeStudio: A surrealist adventure where a game developer is brought in to consult on a criminal case, and the central mystery can only be solved through a horror game prototype.
Project C from Half Mermaid: This mysterious project is helmed by Sam Barlow (Her Story, Immortality) and Brandon Cronenberg (Infinity Pool).
Blumhouse will share more information on its launch titles in the future, but itâs heartening to see an investment in weird little horror games. Titles like Buckshot Roulette and Arctic Eggs have proven that thereâs plenty of appetite for these strange, unnerving experiences, and I canât wait to solve the hideous mysteries at the core of each of these games.

The Power Rangers will once again take on Rita â and Rita.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Ritaâs Rewind trailer puts the five fighters in a whole bunch of scenarios, fighting a whole bunch of putties and other enemies in different locations: on the street, in the arcade, on the roof, at the carnival (on a rollercoaster!), and on motorcycles. And yes, you can morph. It looks sick, and with the iconic music, it looks like itâll evoke the same feelings of the original retro games.

"Ex-Silent Hill devs show off new horror game Slitterhead, a gory mix of The Thing and Driver: San Francisco","The team of ex-Silent Hill developers known as Bokeh Game Studio gave horror fans a lengthy look at their new game Slitterhead on Friday at Summer Game Fest, revealing something fans might not have expected. Slitterhead looks like less of a creeping, psychological horror game in the vein of Silent Hill or Siren, and more of an action game involving swords and guns.
The intriguing twist, though, is that the weapons players will use to battle horrible mutations in Slitterhead are made of blood, bones, and viscera extracted from the characters you play as. And the characters you play as appear to be possessed by a tiny parasitic brainworm, which you control. As that worm, you can seemingly possess every man, woman, and dog on the street, leaping from organism to organism in a kind of parasitic parkour. Traversal through the world of Slitterhead is guts-based, too; we see characters swinging through the gameâs city on grappling hooks made of gore.
Slitterhead also looks a little janky, in the way that PlayStation 2-era games could be. But that doesnât appear to detract from the gameâs overall compelling gameplay mechanics, which evoke busted-but-beloved games like Tokyo Jungle, Driver: San Francisco, and Messiah, with plenty of The Thing-style body horror thrown in. At one point in Slitterheadâs first gameplay trailer, we see a guy get his arm sliced off, then grab it with his own veins and reattach it, which absolutely kicks ass.
Bokeh Game Studio will release Slitterhead on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X on Nov. 8. The game studio was founded in 2021 by former staffers of PlayStationâs Japan Studio, where they developed the Siren and Gravity Rush games.
Bokeh is led by game designer Keiichiro Toyama, who co-founded the studio with game director Junya Okura and producer Kazunobu Sato, both of whom worked on the Siren series.",https://www.polygon.com/24173650/slitterhead-gameplay-trailer-summer-game-fest-bokeh,2024-06-07 21:56:49
Persona devsâ Metaphor: ReFantazio out in October,"Metaphor: ReFantazio will be released on Oct. 11, developer Studio Zero and publisher Atlus announced Friday at Geoff Keighleyâs Summer Game Fest. Atlus artistic designer Shigenori Soejima and art director Katsura Hashino appeared on stage at the event to introduce the game.
Metaphor: ReFantazio is a role-playing game where you can transform into a more powerful form based on your job, or archetype. ReFantazio is expected to have more than 40 different archetypes to choose from. The release date trailer shown at Summer Game Fest showed some of these archetypes in action, as a bunch of characters wielded magic to take on a source of evil. Youâll create a party to take on the bad guys and save the world, naturally. 
Itâs created by folks who made the Persona games, making it a seriously-anticipated title. You can see the Atlus DNA everywhere, such as in the stylish characters and splashy user design. Metaphor: ReFantazio is expected to be Atlusâ âfirst ever, full-scale fantasy RPG,â the developer said in 2023, when the game was revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase. (The project was first teased, however, more than six years ago.)
Metaphor: ReFantazio will be released Oct. 11 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. Pre-orders are open now on the Microsoft Store. ",https://www.polygon.com/24173992/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-october-2024,2024-06-07 21:47:30
"Civilization 7 announced, coming in 2025","The next game in the Civilization turn-based strategy game franchise is coming in 2025. At Summer Game Fest on Friday, developer Firaxis and publisher 2K Games announced Sid Meierâs Civilization 7 with a big, history-spanning trailer.
Sid Meierâs Civilization 7 is confirmed for release on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and promises to empower players âto build the greatest empire the world has ever known.â Gameplay details beyond that are scant, but Firaxis promises a full reveal of Civilization 7 in August.
Itâs been more than seven years since the last game in the series, Sid Meierâs Civilization 6, was released for Mac and Windows PC. Since then, Civ 6 has expanded greatly, with six civilization and scenario packs, and ports to Android, iOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
The Civilization series dates back to 1991, with the original MS-DOS release produced and designed by Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley. The series has sold more than 51 million units worldwide since then, according to 2K.

The Legend of Vox Machinaâs new title sequence will have to hold us over till October,"The animated Critical Role series doesnât come back till October 3 â but till then, we have the title sequence for the new season to hold us over. 
The new Legend of Vox Machina title sequence shows the characters all doing super duper cool moves (and also having super somber looks at the camera when something Dramaticâ¢ happens). We also see glimpses of some of the foes and friends theyâll meet this season. 
The plot synopsis for season 3 is below: 
Everything is at stake in the long-awaited Season Three of The Legend of Vox Machina. The Chroma Conclaveâs path of destruction spreads like wildfire while the Cinder King hunts down Vox Machina. Our lovable band of misfits must rise above inner (and outer) demons to try and save their loved ones, TalâDorei, and all of Exandria.
Based on the super popular actual play web series, The Legend of Vox Machina follows a group of unlikely heroes as they band together to save the world. Critical Role founders and cast members Laura Bailey (The Last of Us: Part II), Taliesin Jaffe (World of Warcraft), Ashley Johnson (The Last of Us), Liam OâBrien (Marvelâs Avengers), Marisha Ray (Fallout 76), Sam Riegel (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), and Travis Willingham (Marvelâs Avengers) all return to their roles, with GM Matthew Mercer (Baldurâs Gate 3) also voicing various characters.

Warhammer 40K illustrator John Blancheâs steps out with his own line of âgrimdark femmesâ miniatures,"John Blanche left an indelible mark on science fiction, high fantasy, and the world of gaming as a whole with his iconic art depicting the Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 universes. Now, after 46 years at Games Workshop, heâs stepping out on his own with a new line of miniatures. 
Launched quietly on Tuesday, the Kickstarter campaign for his inaugural MÃ¶rderin line launched with four exquisite âgrimdark femmes miniatures.â Unsurprisingly, the project has crushed its funding goal. The campaign only runs one week, however, so potential backers should move fast. A retail offering is being planned, but this pre-order opportunity ends on June 12.
Additional miniatures may be unlocked as stretch goals. Delivery is estimated for March or April 2025.
The MÃ¶rderin line began as a series of Blanche artworks, rendered in his unique style with its graceful lines and deep shadows. The subjects evoke some of his most memorable work, with boots and hats for days alongside rough and ready futuristic weaponry. But the most decisive element of the entire series is a kind of high-fashion runway strut, reminiscent to his classic portrait of a Sister of Battle.
There was no lore of any kind mentioned in the campaign, but we do have an idea of where Blancheâs head has been since he left Games Workshop. Right after retirement he published a photo of a female Space Marine kitbash, telling Polygon that it was part of a new collection of miniatures he was creating for Trench Crusade, an in-development wargame from Mordheim designer Tuomas Pirinen and Diablo 4 Artist Mike Franchina.
For this project, Blancheâs figures are being produced by Zealot Miniatures in Siocast thermoplastic. Thatâs the same material used for lines such as Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone and The Witcher Role-Playing Game. For detailed information on how Siocast differs from the plastics and resins you might be used to working with, check out this video featuring PhD chemist Brent Amberger of Goobertown Hobbies.",https://www.polygon.com/24173689/john-blanche-morderin-grimdark-femmes-kickstarter-release-date-price,2024-06-07 19:41:41
How to watch Summer Game Fest 2024 âÂ and what to expect,"Summer Game Fest 2024âs kickoff event streams globally this Friday, promising new game reveals, announcements, and world premiere trailers. Host Geoff Keighley says viewers can expect a two-hour live showcase âfeaturing updates from the worldâs top game development studiosâ and game announcements from smaller, single-person studios.
Confirmed to appear at SGF 2024 are Capcomâs Monster Hunter Wilds, Atlusâ Metaphor: ReFantazio, and the first game from Blumhouse Games, the new label from the production company behind the Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and M3GAN movies. Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy Entertainment will also be present, likely with something new for its Alan Wake sequel. Viewers can also expect upcoming games Slitterhead, Dune: Awakening, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Neva to show up in some form. We might even get a peek at the next Civilization game, based on early leaks out of the show.
Given Keighleyâs history of game reveals, itâs also reasonable to expect an appearance from old pal Hideo Kojima, whose Kojima Productions is currently working on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and OD.
Keighley has tried to temper expectations about what else we can expect from Summer Game Fest, calling it a âlighter yearâ in a Q&A streamed on Twitch. Whether thatâs enough to  keep wild speculation in check remains to be seen, but hereâs how to watch Summer Game Fest 2024 regardless of what youâre anticipating.
Summer Game Fest will stream live on Friday, June 7, from the YouTube Theater in Los Angeles, starting at 2 p.m. PDT/5 p.m. EDT/11 p.m. CEST (find your time zone here). The show will be broadcast on the following Summer Game Fest channels:
For the rest of other big gaming events happening this summer, check out Polygonâs full schedule of ânot-E3â and Summer Game Fest 2024 livestreams.

The newest Humble Bundle is full of hits from Warhammerâs Black Library,"The newest Humble Bundle is a treasure trove of lore for fans of Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Age of Sigmar. The bundle includes 27 items from the Black Library, and there are some real gems here, as well as the start to several series. These books are in ePUB and MOBI format, which means that they can be read digitally on an ereader or browser.
The highlights include some anthologies from the Horus Heresy, a sprawling prequel series that takes place 10,000 years before the main 40K setting. Lupercalâs War, Cthoniaâs Reckoning, and Sons of the Emperor all include tales from the Heresy.

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
If you prefer more modern stories, thereâs some absolute bangers that take place in the dark millennium. Fire Caste by Peter Fehervari is one of my favorite 40K books; itâs Apocalypse Now through a grimdark, far future lens. The Lords of Silence by Chris Wraight follows the corrupted Death Guard, Chaos Space Marines in service to the Plague God Nurgle. You might think thatâs an unrelatable point of view, but Wraight does a fantastic job at getting the reader invested in these characters. Valedor by Guy Haley is also considered to be one of the best novels about the Aeldari.
In addition to these books Iâd heartily recommend, thereâs a wealth of literature I havenât had the chance to pore through yet, like Dark Apostle, Space Wolf, Lucius: The Faultless Blade, The Talon of Horus, Ice Guard, Avenging Son, and Titanicus.
Thereâs also a selection of books from the Age of Sigmar, the wildly inventive and imaginative setting that was born out of the original Warhammer Fantasy Battles. I, for one, am looking forward to learning about historyâs biggest hater in Nagash: The Undying King, by Josh Reynolds.
If youâre a fan of Warhammer, but arenât sure where to start when it comes to the massive Black Library, this bundle is a great â and relatively inexpensive â option. The Bundle will end on June 27.",https://www.polygon.com/24173734/black-library-humble-bundle-warhammer-40k-horus-heresy-age-sigmar,2024-06-07 17:06:00
"Daybreak, a game about climate change, honored as a finalist in the 2024 Games for Change Awards","Games for Change, a leading progressive voice in gaming, spent 2023 getting way into tabletop. Now itâs back for the summer convention circuit with the Games for Change Festival in New York City, held this year from June 27 to 28. It will also award the second annual Best Board or Tabletop Game for Impact Award. Polygon has an exclusive look at the exceptional finalists, plus details of an extraordinary panel to be hosted by yours truly.
âWe made the decision last year to expand our programming and our awards category to include [...] analog games to the Festival for the first time,â said Games for Change president Susanna Pollack. âI feel like this is something that has been [inquired about] for years, and we felt that the momentum and enthusiasm had grown so much that we really would be remiss if we ignored the demand.â
The global tabletop games industry clearly got the message, as Pollack said submissions were up 71% compared to 2023. Three finalists, described below, were selected by a jury chosen by Games for Change. The programâs partner, Hasbro, will make the final selection.
âThis program beautifully showcases the ability for designers to connect people through a shared love of games,â said Brian Baker, senior vice president and global play lead of board games at Hasbro. âThe creativity demonstrated by the applicants was truly impressive. Crafting an engaging game is already a challenge, but the added dimension of tackling social issues inherent in this program makes the submissions even more inspiring.â
Here are the finalists, which will all be available to play during the Games for Change Festival:
Designed by Pandemic creator and Pandemic Legacy co-creator Matt Leacock with Matteo Menapace, Daybreak is a game about stopping global climate change. Itâs currently available directly from the publisher, at local game stores, and on Amazon. 
âWe were really impressed by how deep the research was, and the partnerships that went into designing the game,â said Pollack. âTheyâve also partnered with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They represent the domain experts, and to have that kind of expertise in the design process from the beginning is a model that we certainly advocate for. [...] The integrity of the data and the information that was infused in what is a beautifully designed game [...] helps incorporate a complicated issue of climate change in a way that feels personal. That balance is not always easy to achieve.â
A print-and-play card game, Empiric Pediatrics 2023 is intended to help medical students learn about antibiotics. Residents and practicing physicians can also keep up with their own continuing education thanks to the platformâs regular updates across multiple disciplines. 
âThere is a need for, and a real interest in, finding creative ways [...] to infuse [games] into learning opportunities for higher education, and in specific disciplines,â Pollack said. âThe traditional methods of study and memorization in the field of medicine is effective [...] but the opportunity to create these game-like learning tools, for us, is a great application of games and game design into different sectors. The team behind Empiric Pediatrics [...] demonstrated this really well, and also demonstrated the scalability of this model to other fields.â
Martinezâs playful, colorful design is both modular and semi-cooperative. In it, players work together to solve the problems of the city that they share. Itâs intended to promote civics and a focus on citizen-driven urban solutions.
âTrilhas Urbanas translates into Urban Trails,â Pollack said. âIt allows players to problem solve with a community focus. [...] Thereâs this wonderful critical thinking and problem solving [through] what can be framed as social emotional skills that are involved and can empower youth in urban areas. [...] Thereâs also this super fun approach of how you can configure the board, [...] so thereâs this high replay value and how you can shape the board and that is an attractive feature as well.â
In a further expansion of the Games for Change Festival, I will also be participating on behalf of Polygon this year. My panel, titled âFlip the Table: Rewriting the Rules of Tabletop Game Design and Social Impact,â will touch on many different issues. Iâm pleased to note that panelists will include: Tory Brown, designer of Votes for Women; Elizabeth Hargrave, designer of Wingspan and a founding board member of the Tabletop Game Designers Association; Eric M. Lang, designer of Blood Rage and co-designer of Life in Reterra; and Andrew Navarro, founder and creative director of Earthborne Games, publisher of Earthborne Rangers. If youâd like to attend in person, tickets are on sale now and Iâd love to meet you at the event. The panel will be shared online as well.

You can find additional information about Polygonâs ethics policy here.]",https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24172379/games-for-change-awards-tabletop-2024-polygon-panel,2024-06-07 14:30:00
Wallace and Gromitâs penguin nemesis returns in teaser for new Netflix short,"I always breathe a sigh of relief after the announcement of a new Aardman Animation project. The studio behind some of the most imaginative stop-motion projects of the last 50 years has never been a household name or box-office titan like Walt Disney Animation, but founders Peter Lord and David Sproxtonâs quirky claymation company remains just as vital to the art. So you can imagine how loudly I yelled âcheeeeeeese!â when Netflix announced a new outing for Aardmanâs unofficial mascots, Wallace and Gromit. 
Due out âthis winterâ (but positioned as a 2025 release in Netflixâs news release), Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl picks back up the well-mannered bumbling inventor Wallace and his vigilant dog Gromit standing on the edge of our current techpocalypse. Wallace, it seems, is fully Silicon Valley-pilled, and âGromitâs concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified,â per a synopsis. The tipping point: Wallaceâs invention of an AI âsmartâ gnome that goes rogue. But thereâs another familiar face pulling the strings: Feathers McGraw. 
Introduced in the 1993 Oscar-winning short The Wrong Trousers â one of the all-time great chase movies? â Feathers is a silent criminal mastermind known to masquerade as a chicken using a red rubber glove worn as a hat. He has appeared in blink-and-youâll-miss-it cameos in other Wallace and Gromit shorts, the pairâs lone feature film, The Curse of the Wererabbit, and even the woefully under-discussed 2003 video game Wallace & Gromit in Project Zoo, but Vengeance Most Fowl is expected to give the penguin his true sequel moment, as seen in a brief teaser for the film.
While the distinctly British output from Aardman has struggled to connect with American  audiences â films like The Pirates! Band of Misfits, Shaun the Sheep, and Early Man were hits around the world and blips in the States â the streaming era has been kind to the studio. Along with producing last yearâs sequel to Chicken Run for Netflix, the studio also collaborated with Disney for the first time in 2023, producing a segment for the Star Wars: Visions anthology series. And last December, Aardman even produced a Wallace and Gromit VR game for Meta Quest, reminding us there is no place these two canât go.
A new Wallace and Gromit short on Netflix is a no-brainer, and a sign of respect: if Wes Anderson could do it, obviously so can Aardman.
Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl is once again directed by longtime Aardman creative Nick Park. Actor Ben Whitehead returns as the voice of Wallace, after taking over Peter Sallis starting with The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The short is set for this winter, teeing it up right up for Oscar season.",https://www.polygon.com/24173526/wallace-and-gromit-short-penguin-vengeance-most-fowl-release-2025,2024-06-07 13:15:00
You can get the Eye of Sauron in Lego form with the new Barad-dÃ»r set,"Mordorâs most terrifying monument is now available in Lego form. A new Barad-dÃ»r Lego set is coming from Lego and Warner Bros. Discovery this summer, the two companies announced on Tuesday. 
The set depicts Sauronâs massive tower as well as his glowing Eye that sits at its peak. The tower also opens up into a detailed throne room that includes a hidden map and a ladder to the top floor. The middle sections of the tower also have a variety of different modable options, including a feast table, an orc armory, and more, while the bottom of the tower includes a working door at the base.
The Lego set stands at over 32 inches tall, 11 inches wide, and 17 inches long. It comes with a hidden secret as well: if you buy multiple sets, you can stack several different versions of the middle section to make an even more imposing version of Barad-dÃ»r. But the price for multiple versions of this new 5,471 piece Lord of the Rings set will be pretty steep, with each one running $459.99. 
Along with the tower itself, and a glowing center brick for the Eye of Sauron, the Barad-dÃ»r set will include 10 minifigures, including Sauron, the Mouth of Sauron, an Orc, Frodo, Sam, Gollum, Gothmog, and more. On top of all that, if you buy the set between June 1 and June 7, youâll also get a Lord of the Rings: Fell Beast Lego seat, which features a version of the ominous flying creature with fully posable wings alongside A Nazgul minifigure. 
The Lord of the Rings: Barad-dÃ»r set is out now, but currently on backorder from Legoâs website.

The next Helldivers 2 Warbond has new rewards â and some big changes,"A new Warbond is on the way to Helldivers 2, and itâs the first step in Arrowhead shaking up the gameâs update schedule. The Viper Commandos Warbond is themed after jungle combat â camo prints, red berets, bare arms, throwing knives, skull masks, and everything else you can equip while CCRâs âFortunate Sonâ blasts over a speaker nearby.
Warbonds can be unlocked with 1000 Super Credits, which can be purchased with real money or collected around minor points of interest on the map. Fans have criticized Warbonds for coming a little too frequently without enough unique items to justify them, and the Viper Commandos Warbond takes that feedback into account.
âBased on player input, weâre changing our approach to Warbonds moving forward in a couple of ways,â wrote community manager Katherine Baskin on the official Sony site. âFirstly, weâre slowing down the pace at which we release Warbonds to give us a little bit more time to polish these designs before theyâre released. Secondly, we are changing the arrangement of items in each Warbond to make room for new item types. Itâs time to focus on quality over quantity.â
Players can unlock a new Liberator Carbine, designed for close quarters combat, as well as a new secondary weapon that packs a lot of punch in the SG-22 Bushwhacker triple-barrel sawed off shotgun. The PH-9 Predator armor is a clear reference to, well, Predator â and Iâm tempted to unlock it just for the cute beret. For those who prefer heavy armor, the PH-202 Twigsnapper keeps similar aesthetics with a little more protection. Both armors feature bare arms and a new Peak Physique passive, which improves melee damage and weapon handling.
The most exciting weapon is a new utility item: a throwing knife. Iâm not sure if throwing knives will pack the same punch as shotguns and orbital lasers, but it definitely scores points for being cool and stylish.
The Viper Commandos Warbond also features camo skins for the hellpods, Exosuits, and Pelican-1. It should be nice to be able to customize these things, adding a certain panache to the otherwise plain-looking mech suits and hellpods. A new booster, Experimental Infusion, makes stims even more of a life-saver by giving injections a boost to movement speed and damage reduction.
The Warbond also comes with the typical rewards of capes, player cards, and emotes.
Itâs interesting to see Arrowhead shake things up. There are some big narrative happenings right now, since players turned the super colony of Meridia into an ominous black hole. If things escalate further, at least weâll have these fun new toys to throw at our alien enemies. The Viper Commandos Warbond will release on all platforms on June 13.

Haymitchâs story will finally be told in new Hunger Games book and movie,"Suzanne Collins is writing a new Hunger Games book â and congrats everyone, itâs the Haymitch prequel story many (myself included) have been clamoring for. And in a surprise to no one, itâs becoming a movie, too.
Everyone say thank you to The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes star Rachel Zegler for manifesting this back in 2021. 
youâre welcome guys https://t.co/KbMfebjJNZ
Titled Sunrise on the Reaping, Collinsâ new book takes place 24 years before the first Hunger Games book â on the dawn of the Second Quarter Quell. If youâre not super plugged into the Hunger Games timeline, thatâs the game that Katniss and Peetaâs grumpy mentor Haymitch Abernathy (played by Woody Harrelson in the movies) won, by outsmarting the Gamemakers. 
A new Hunger Games book right after the box office success of Hunger Games prequel movie might seem like a cash grab, but as longtime Hunger Games movie producer Nina Jacobson told Polygon last year, Collins is selective about when she returns to this world. 
âSuzanne, the originator and North Star of everything that we try to do with these books, she doesnât write just to make money,â Jacobson said. âShe writes when she has something to say.â
And boy, does Collins have something to say this time! 
âWith Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Humeâs idea of implicit submission and, in his words, âthe easiness with which the many are governed by the few,ââ Collins said in a press release from Scholastic. âThe story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question âReal or not real?â seems more pressing to me every day.â
Jacobson promised that the only way she would make another Hunger Games movie is if Collins delivered new source material â and she is standing by her word. On the heels of the novel announcement, Lionsgate announced that it was already in the works on a movie version of Sunrise on the Reaping. Francis Lawrence, who directed several Hunger Games films including The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is in talks to direct. Haymitchâs backstory was cut from the main Hunger Games films in order to streamline them, so this should be a perfect chance to finally showcase the whole story.
Sunrise on the Reaping arrives to bookstores on March 18, 2025. The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping will hit theaters on Nov. 20, 2026.
Update: After publication of this article, Lionsgate announced plans for a feature adaptation. Weâve updated the story to reflect both announcements.",https://www.polygon.com/24172776/hunger-games-new-book-movie-haymitch-prequel,2024-06-06 16:10:11
"BioWare renames Dragon Age: Dreadwolf to focus on its heroes, not its villain","BioWareâs Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is no more. The next entry in the role-playing game franchise is now known as Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the developer announced Thursday, ahead of a planned first look at gameplay on June 11.
Gary McKay, executive producer on Dragon Age and general manager of BioWare, says the name change for the fourth mainline Dragon Age game reflects the developerâs focus not on the gameâs antagonist, but on the heroes youâll play as in The Veilguard.
âEach of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them â as well as their lives,â McKay said in a blog post. âYouâll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions â not your enemies â are the heart of this new experience.
âSo, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didnât show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how youâll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas.â Hence, Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
BioWare and publisher Electronic Arts have been using the name Dragon Age: Dreadwolf for their follow-up to 2014âs Dragon Age: Inquisition for the past two years. So there are still plenty of product listings and watermarked screenshots that currently carry the old name for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. EA and BioWare will have no small amount of work for themselves to condition players to forget the old Dreadwolf name, but hopefully the gameplay they show next week will impress to the point where those memories are wiped away. No pressure, folks!
If you want to see 15 minutes of gameplay from Dragon Age: The Veilguard, youâll need to tune in to the Dragon Age YouTube channel on June 11 at 8 a.m. PDT/11 a.m. EDT. BioWareâs new role-playing game promises to be an âincredible single-player game, with all the choices, characters and world building youâd expect from us,â McKay said. 
The fourth Dragon Age game was first teased back in 2018. McKay said that over the course of the gameâs lengthy development, BioWare experimented with multiple concepts, including a multiplayer take on Dragon Age.

"MultiVersus went away for a year, came back different, and fans arenât sure about it","The strange tale of MultiVersus continues. The game was odd enough to begin with: a free-to-play Smash Bros.-inspired fighter featuring the multifarious intellectual property of the Warner Bros. Discovery corporation, in which Looney Tunes icons can battle DC heroes and characters from the likes of Adventure Time and Game of Thrones â thereâs even LeBron James.
A successful open beta launched in 2022, but in June 2023 it was taken offline for almost a full year for a complete revamp â an unprecedented step for a live service game that seemed out of proportion to the work it needed. Now itâs back, and fans are puzzled, to say the least, about how much itâs changed.
Some changes are a matter of taste. Many players on the MultiVersus subreddit and elsewhere say the game has been slowed down dramatically â which is Polygonâs impression too, from a quick playtest â and while this change is unpopular with many, not everyone agrees.
But what has really alarmed the gameâs fanbase is that this new âlaunchâ version of MultiVersus has returned missing features and settings that were present in the open beta â and that radical changes to progression and the way characters are unlocked have been made.
So far, developer Player First Games has only responded to feedback about the missing features. Game director Tony Huynh posted on X to reassure fans that features like team colors, end-of-game stats, adjustable input buffer settings, and the option to swap side and neutral attacks are âincoming.â Huynh explained that the extensive rebuild required the team to move the game from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, leaving the developers without the time to implement every feature before the relaunch date.
Many of these features are currently  implemented and are in testing and we had planned, but were left out due to time as we had to rebuild every screen and feature again to support our new netcode and Unreal Engine 5 switch. Thanks again! I hope some of this context is helpful.
âMany of these features are currently implemented and are in testing and we had planned, but were left out due to time as we had to rebuild every screen and feature again to support our new netcode and Unreal Engine 5 switch,â he said. Responding to queries from players, Huynh indicated that the next patch would address performance issues, and that a spectator mode was in development, too.
But Player First Games has been silent on what is perhaps the most common gripe from players, which is that progression â both unlocking new characters, and leveling up the ones you have â is painfully grindy. The main way to unlock new characters (short of buying them) is to to earn Fighter currency by playing the new PvE Rifts mode, while character XP is awarded for completing dailies and quests, but not for competing in matches. PvP match play is MultiVersusâ central and most popular mode, so excluding it from both forms of progression has severely slowed down the rate at which most players are able to earn new characters and upgrade them.
The last point of frustration for players is perhaps the least surprising. In its open beta version, Player First Games generously unlocked all MultiVersusâ fighters in the gameâs offline local play mode. Thatâs no longer the case, leaving players without a way to try fighters before buying them â and leaving fighting game tournament organizers facing a steep cost if they want to make the full game available for competitors to play.
Looking for ways to claw back more revenue from this free-to-play game is one of the easier-to-understand (if still disappointing) decisions that WB Games has made lately. Taking a popular game offline for a year for an arguably unnecessary engine swap (among other things) is not. Polygon has contacted Player First Games and WB Games for comment.

United Paizo Workers union and a fundraiser for trans rights are among the finalists for the 2024 Diana Jones Award,"Though the original Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming trophy is thought to be gone â it got lost in the mail in 2019 â the show must go on: A winner must be selected from five nominees that have shown excellence in their field of gaming. 
The award can go to anyone or anything, according to the organizationâs FAQ â concepts, publishers, products, and people. The breadth of that scope is on display for this yearâs nominee class: Adepticon, the Midwest miniatures games convention that hosts the North American Golden Demons; Ami Baio, game designer of Pink Tiger Games; Fastaval, an RPG and board game convention held in Denmark; TTRPGs for Trans Rights in Florida, an itch.io bundle that raised $283,977 for trans advocacy and support groups in Florida; and the United Paizo Workers, tabletop gamingâs first workers union.

âThe United Paizo Workers are delighted and honored to be a finalist for the Diana Jones Award this year,â United Paizo Workers steward and Paizo organized play coordinator Alex Speidel told Polygon. âTo be recognized among such industry luminaries is a testament to the power and importance of worker solidarity in this industry. We hope this nomination shows others in the industry that not only is advocating for yourself and collective action in the workplace possible, but that doing so is a mark of honor among your peers.â
Speidel also mentioned that United Paizo Workers member Rue Dickey is actually nominated twice; Dickey led the TTRPGs for Trans Rights in Florida charity bundle. âWe also want to recognize the tremendous achievements of one of our members, Rue Dickey, who is nominated alongside us for their advocacy and charity work for the transgender community,â Speidel said.
A winner will be chosen at an awards ceremony held July 31 in Indianapolis, Indiana ahead of tabletop gaming convention GenCon. Who chooses? Thatâs actually a secret. The committee keeps it that way to make it âimpossible for a manufacturer or publisher to stuff the ballot or interfere with the voting,â according to the award FAQs. The committee is âmostly anonymous,â though several folks have been public about their involvement, including game designer Matt Forbeck.
As for the trophy, a new one was debuted in 2022 â itâs pointy! The original trophy is the last copy of the unpopular and poorly-received The Adventures of Indiana Jones Role-Playing Game, published in 1984 by TSR. The game was set ablaze, then immortalized in acrylic.
Last year, roleplaying game Coyote & Crow took home the top prize; âCoyote & Crow is an RPG created by Cherokee designer Connor Alexander. In the game Alexander shrewdly imagines an alternate universe that exists outside of the horrors of colonialism,â the awards committee wrote on its website. The first Diana Jones Award went to Wizards of the Coast founder Peter Adkison.

"Dimension 20âs next season does â80s action movies, Jumanji style","Dropout released a first trailer for âNever Stop Blowing Upâ on Wednesday, lifting the curtain on the next season of Dimension 20. 
Hosted by founding game master Brennan Lee Mulligan in a series of increasingly incinerated outfits, âNever Stop Blowing Upâ will follow six strip-mall employees played by Jacob Wysocki, Ify Nwadiwe, Ally Beardsley, Alex Song-Xia, Isabella Roland, and Rekha Shankar â but it sounds like they wonât be strip-mall losers for very long. 
Our heroes find themselves âsucked into a magic VHS tape, transforming into high-octane action heroes - and must figure out how to navigate the movie to get home,â according to Dropoutâs news release. 
The trailer makes clear that those action heroes are drawn from a specific mold, echoing the likes of John McClane, Rambo, Dominic Toretto, and more. There also appears to be some kind of prop mechanic going on? With items like a dynamite bomb, a deck of cards, a bundle of âcocaine,â or a pack of cigarettes rotating around the table. 
Fans will have to wait a few weeks to unravel those mysteries, however. âNever Stop Blowing Upâ premieres on June 26 on Dropout TV, and run for 10 episodes. ",https://www.polygon.com/24172006/dimension-20-never-stop-blowing-up-dropout,2024-06-05 17:30:00
Dave Bautista takes on the entire assassin underworld in The Killerâs Game trailer,"Itâs finally Dave Bautistaâs time to shine as a bona fide action lead. The first trailer for The Killerâs Game, an assassin comedy with a star-studded cast and action royalty behind the camera, has dropped. The movie, based on the novel by The Walking Dead comics co-writer Jay Bonansinga, is coming to theaters September 13.
Bautista plays an assassin diagnosed with a terminal illness who decides to put out a hit on himself for a quick death, rather than have him and his partner suffer through the deterioration of his health. But when he finds out his doctor made a mistake and heâs not actually dying, he has to fend for his life against some of the deadliest killers in the world. Itâs a bit similar to the set up of last yearâs King of Killers, starring Frank Grillo as an assassin who put out a hit on himself, but with a more fun twist and a much more exciting lineup.
Bautista has been largely relegated to side roles in the action genre, and hereâs a real chance for him to shine in a genre well-suited to his considerable skills. And you can bet heâll shine, with the support around him. The Killerâs Game is directed by legendary stunt performer and action director J.J. Perry, who has been involved in a significant percentage of the great American action movies of the past 30 years, from Blade to John Wick. Perryâs feature debut as a director, Day Shift, was a fun vampire action comedy starring Jamie Foxx with creative action choreography and camera work. 
Bautista will also have more support than just Perry. The Killerâs Game has a tantalizing cast, with Ben Kingsley (Iâm obsessed with how he says âThere are only two ways out of the killerâs game, Josephâ), Pom Klementieff, Sofia Boutella, Terry Crews, and WWE wrestler Drew McIntyre all involved. For the action diehards, the presence of Scott Adkins, Marko Zaror (who features heavily in the trailer), and Daniel Bernhardt is especially appealing. All three are legends in their own right, and Bernhardt in particular has made a career of making movie stars look god at kicking his ass (Atomic Blonde, Nobody).
The projectâs been in the works pretty much since Bonansingaâs novel came out in 1997. At different points over the past few decades, Wesley Snipes, Michael Keaton, and Jason Statham were each attached in the lead role. But ultimately, itâs Bautista who got the part, and it seems like a promising vehicle for his combination of charm, humor, and physical ability as a former professional athlete.
The trailer advertises lots of action and plenty of gore, as Bautista shoots, stabs, and garrotes his way through a bevy of targets. The comedyâs a bit hit-or-miss for me in the trailer, but thatâs how trailers go sometimes. The lineup of talent and the teases of great action are more than enough for me to be counting down the days to September.

New Hades 2 patch decreases the likelihood of a âpatently unfairâ Chronos,"If youâve been struggling to beat Chronos, Hades 2âs final boss, Tuesdayâs patch might give you a boost. Donât get me wrong, Chronos will still be hard to take on, but developer Supergiant Games made some tweaks that decrease the likeliness that the boss will be âpatently unfair.â
Hades 2âs second patch is pretty big â itâs got a whole slew of general changes, UI and menu updates, and weapon upgrades alongside changes to different foes. Supergiant Games said player feedback was used to âinspireâ the changes brought forth in Tuesdayâs patch. Boon updates, which give players increased abilities, will be included in the next patch, Supergiant Games said. The full patch notes are included at the bottom of this post, but letâs go over some of the biggest ones.
Supergiant Games will allow players to encounter one more Olympian each night, just like in Hades â that means one additional boon. Youâll also be more likely to find another boon or reward in Erebus. MelinoÃ«âs weapons, Nocturnal Arms and Daedalus Hammer, have been updated; for instance, Nocturnal Armsâ Argent Skull channels attacks faster and âhits a larger area,â according to the patch notes. The Daedelus Hammer had a ton of upgrades outright removed from the game, replaced with new stuff. One instance is the removal of Double Cataclysm, which has been replaced by Mirrored Thrasher, which lets all attacks hit twice (but you take more damage).
Beyond Chronos, several other bosses were tweaked, like Infernal Cerbeus, which got attack pattern changes. The Chaos Trials, which are basically challenge runs, also had their difficulty reduced.

"The 7th Citadel, spiritual successor to The 7th Continent, is back on Kickstarter for a limited time","Given the nature of the work that I do here as Polygonâs tabletop editor, I end up playing an awful lot of board games by myself. Not board games that you should play by yourself, mind you. Instead of luxuriating with the cardboard equivalent of the Timesâ Sunday crossword, I look more like Bugs Bunny playing baseball. Thatâs why Iâm excited to get my hands on The 7th Citadel, among the best modern solo board games. Itâs also pretty great as a cooperative experience.
Published by Serious Poulp, The 7th Citadel is the descendant of The 7th Continent, a Cthulhu-inspired board game that made waves back in 2015 with a â¬1.2 million campaign. That one Iâve played quite a lot, and I admire its depth and complexity. Players take on the role of explorers who must use their survival skills to prevail against otherworldly odds. But the game itself is just a big box of numbered cards. The system, inspired by Choose Your Own Adventure books, uses those numbered cards â nearly 850 of them in the base game â to tell an elaborate story. Then, at the end of the adventure, you end up with a table covered in a charming isometric map made from the cards youâve drawn.
Not only does the game work exceedingly well as a solo experience, Iâve also played it more or less hot-seat with other members of my family. While I have the attention level to see it through to the end, Iâll often be joined at several points along the way by other explorers. Itâs a delight. 
Meanwhile, Serious Poulp kept on publishing. It blew the doors of its next campaign in 2018, which included a reprint and a big expansion. All told, it earned over $7 million dollars. That effort was later followed up, in 2020, with The 7th Citadel, a dark medieval-inspired tale with nearly identical mechanics. That one pulled in more than â¬3.2 million.
Now the design team of Ludovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter are back for another reprint. This one includes a lavish new version of The 7th Citadel and, like the reprint campaign for The 7th Continent from 2018, also includes a hefty expansion, as well as the promise of more stretch goals as the campaign progresses.
Hereâs a bit from the press release about how it differs from its forebears:
The 7th Citadel differentiates itself from its predecessor by bringing lots of new elements to the table. First of all, it has its own original universe to explore: The 7th Citadelâs story takes place in a post-apocalyptic medieval world called âThe Collapsing Landsâ. Players will step into a dark world filled with mysterious Necrodruids, monstrous plants, and the even more dangerous Burrowers, in a fight for survival spanning multiple adventures called Threats. In terms of mechanics, The 7th Citadel offers exciting new additions such as an evolving world map, customizable Action decks, the possibility for players to develop their own Citadel between scenarios, and much more.
While I may not pony up for the campaign myself, itâs certainly on my radar once it hits retail. But if youâd like to get yours sooner, move fast. The campaign only runs from today until June 19. Copies start at about $54, with delivery expected by Nov. 2025.",https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24171548/7th-citadel-kickstarter-solo-cooperative-adventure-release-date-price,2024-06-04 20:26:05
Helldivers 2âs latest Major Order was (mostly) a narrative success,"I keep returning to Helldivers 2, not because Iâm interested in trying out new weapons or conquering the highest difficulty, but because Iâm totally invested in the current story playing out. As Helldivers, the players are following orders from Super Earth â including the ones that are obviously doomed. Previously, we sprayed Termicide all over planets in order to thwart the voracious Terminid hordes. The Termicide technically backfired, causing hideous mutations and the development of a super colony on Meridia. 
Over the weekend, Helldivers descended on Meridia, using Dark Fluid in order to extinguish the super colony. The mysterious experiment required the brave sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Helldivers... and fans think that the most recent operation may have triggered the arrival of a third enemy faction.
Meridia was once a peaceful swamp planet, but the Terminid Control System â meaning, players spraying Termicide everywhere â hit it particularly hard. By the time Meridia had developed into a super colony, the planet was an utter nightmare, crusted over with Terminids and chitin that developed into terrifying towers. Spore towers, which act as an optional objective that players can destroy in some missions, spotted the terrain everywhere. Massive pits yawned open across the surface of the planet. Spawn nests were absolutely ubiquitous; no matter how many I plugged up with my handy grenade launcher, there were always more dotting the terrain.
Things only escalated once we completed our assigned mission on Meridia. Even on the lowest difficulty possible, finishing the mission triggered an eruption of an endless swarm of flying bugs, flocking towards the delicious Helldivers on the surface. This was a suicide mission in all but name, except command kept sending down Helldivers until we ran out of reinforcements. Meridia was a meat grinder, and I absolutely loved the wild challenge.
Thatâs not to say that the Meridia major order went off flawlessly. There were bugs that plagued the experience â and Iâm not talking about the Terminids. Bile Titans would explode out from underneath the drills that were injecting Dark Fluid, destroying the drills and causing chaos. At the start of the major order, players would all receive a much lower ranking than warranted. Arrowhead was able to iron out some of these issues, but it took time.
While the execution was flawed, the premise was extremely cool â and as we succeeded in the Major Order, I got the treat of watching Meridia collapse and my ship making an FTL jump back to Super Earth. Thereâs just one problem: Whatâs left of Meridia looks a little less like a black hole, and a little more like a wormhole. Iâm no scientist, but itâs possible we just launched a planet full of bugs into some other sector of space for some other faction to find. 
Perhaps the Illuminate, a high-tech alien faction from the first game that have been suspiciously absent from Helldivers 2, will be the ones to receive that particular gift. Either way, Iâm pretty sure that the Meridia story isnât over yet, but the high-stakes mission made for a fun chapter in the ongoing story of the second galactic war. The next Major Order has us claiming Terminid planets to make room for new Super Earth settlements, seemingly unaware of the risks of what weâve done.

Hereâs whatâs included in Hogwarts Legacyâs free summer update,"Hogwarts Legacy is getting a substantial free update this week, more than a year after the game set in the wizarding world of Harry Potter debuted on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. Developer Avalanche Software will roll out Hogwarts Legacyâs summer 2024 update on all platforms on June 6 â hereâs what players can expect. 
The biggest new addition to Hogwarts Legacy is photo mode, which will let players take customized screenshots of their gameplay. The gameâs new photo mode looks like what weâve come to expect from other games with similar features, letting players snap pics and apply various effects, including frames and filters inspired by Hogwartsâ famous houses. You can put your young wizard or witch in various poses â including sitting â and change time of day and seasons for photos.
A new quality of life feature will let players easily reset talent tree points from the Field Guide, but at the cost of 200 in-game gold per talent point.

Avalanche Software is unlocking other exclusives as well: The onyx Hippogriff mount, previously a pre-order exclusive cosmetic item, will be available to all players, as will the Felix Felicis potion recipe, another PlayStation exclusive.

Destiny 2: The Final Shapeâs patch adds Prismatic and the gameâs first episode,"After a decade of Guardians adventuring through Sol, Destiny 2: The Final Shape is finally here. This expansion promises the end of Destinyâs first saga â Light and Darkness â and the birth of the next era of the franchise. It also adds a variety of pretty cool new features, like Prismatic and Fireteam Power.
Below, Iâll go over all the major changes coming to Destiny 2 alongside The Final Shape. If youâre looking for the complete patch notes, continue scrolling.
The star of this patch is obviously The Final Shape expansion, which tells the story of Guardians diving into The Traveler itself to chase down the seriesâ biggest bad to date: The Witness.
This expansion includes a full campaign â which comes in both Legend and normal difficulty â the surrealist and fascinating Pale Heart destination, a new raid, Strike, and a variety of other features that Iâll go into even more detail about below.
Prismatic is probably the wildest addition to Destiny in the franchiseâs history. Normally, Guardians choose what element they want to play as on their particular class and thatâs their Subclass. Every ability deals damage (Arc, Strand, Solar, etc.) until they change to a different element. Prismatic turns all of that on its head by allowing Guardians to combine abilities from multiple elements at once, allowing players to equip an Arc Aspect, a Strand Aspect, a Void grenade, a Stasis Super, or any other combination of elements.
Thatâs all great, but the real kicker there is Transcendence, which is a kind of bonus Super players can get by dealing Dark and Light damage in equal measure. When activating Transcendence, Guardians will gain bonus weapon damage, bonus ability charge rate, and a brand new grenade thatâs exclusive to their class.
In addition to Prismatic, each class is also getting a new Super and a new Aspect for one of their Light subclasses. Titans are getting Twilight Arsenal â which lets them throw massive axes that their teammates can pick up. Hunters are getting Stormâs Edge, a kind of teleporting knife twirl. And Warlocks are getting Song of Flame, which supercharges their normal Solar abilities.
These new Supers are available in the base forms of the Light subclasses they belong to, and Prismatic.
After the launch of the raid in The Final Shape, Guardians will be able to unlock Exotic class items that only work with Prismatic. These new Exotics let Guardians combine perks from two Exotics into a single item. Theyâre randomly rolled and will come from a mysterious activity that takes place somewhere inside The Pale Heart.
After years of players waiting and complaining, Bungie is finally giving Guardians a truly new race: the Dread. These Darkness enemies have some unique combatants â like the Grim, which Bungieâs own devs refer to as âgun batsâ â and enemies that can give Guardians a taste of their own medicine with Strand and Stasis.
These new combatants join forces with The Hive and a variety of other enemy types to ensure The Pale Heart is packed full of stuff for Guardians to kill.
The Final Shape offers a ton of new Exotics, as do most expansions. But in addition to some truly wild newbies â like Still Hunt, a sniper that very literally shoots Golden Gun shots â there are a couple returning faces getting a big glow up. 
The first gun Guardians ever pick up in the Cosmodrome, Khvostov, is finally back as an Exotic in Destiny 2. And despite having already been reimagined as the hand cannon Crimson back in 2018, the Red Death pulse rifle is also back with The Final Shape. 
Destiny has been around for 10 years now, and while the series certainly wasnât known for its story in the beginning, the narrative team has really turned it around in the past few years. Now, as Guardians step up to face The Witness, Bungie is promising an answer to questions players have had for a decade, as well as a satisfying conclusion. 
However, The Final Shape is not the end for Destiny 2 or Destiny â despite the feeling the name conjures. Instead, Destiny 2 will continue on with a new kind of content delivery system, detailed below.
Episodes are Bungieâs reimagined seasons. Instead of four different seasons per year that dole the game out into mini chunks every Tuesday, there will only be three episodes per year that focus on more direct content drops. Each episode is broken up into three distinct acts, each lasting six weeks. Every time a new act comes out, Guardians will get new story, quests, activities, weapons, and even artifacts to play with. 
The idea here is to ensure Destiny feels both consistent and less formulaic than seasons.
Finally, one of the more exciting changes for players looking to bring their friends in Destiny 2 is Fireteam Power and the leveling changes. With The Final Shape, Guardians will be able to share their Power with Fireteam members of a lower level in most activities. The Guardian with the highest Power will be anointed the leader of the group, and everyone else will be brought up to the leaderâs Power minus five. This allows anyone to drag their friends through some of the gameâs best content without needing to have that awkward âwe have to get your Power up firstâ conversation.
This change comes paired with sweeping fixes to how Bungie assigns difficulty to activities. Only certain activities, like raids, will use Power anymore. Other activities, like the campaigns, will have a fixed difficulty, meaning Guardians canât over- or under-level it.

Like a Dragon: Yakuza is Amazonâs Fallout follow-up â and it drops in October,"After the huge success of its Fallout series, Amazon has moved quickly to follow it up with another video game adaptation. Like a Dragon: Yakuza, a live-action Japanese production based on Segaâs long-running series of gangster soaps, drops on Prime Video worldwide on Oct. 25, 2024.
Well, half of it does, anyway. Itâs a six-episode series, to be released in two chunks: the first three episodes on Oct. 25 and the next three on Nov. 1.
The show follows series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and his friends across two time periods, in 1995 and 2005 â suggesting an adaptation of the first game, which came out in 2005 and followed Kazuma after he was released from a 10-year prison sentence. Kazuma is played by Ryoma Takeuchi, star of the Kamen Rider Drive series. The series is directed by Masaharu Take, with a story by Sean Crouch and Nakamura Yugo, and a Japanese screenplay by Yoshida Yasuhiro and Yamada Kana.
Amazon describes the show as âan original crime-suspense-action seriesâ that âfollows the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.â
âAudience will enjoy the showâs human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu,â Takeuchi said in a statement. âMoreover, please take a look Kiryuâs intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.â 
Reading between the lines, it seems like Amazon has swooped in to acquire an already-filmed independent Japanese production, which explains why the showâs release is only a few months away. Amazonâs streaming muscle and deep pockets mean the show gets a simultaneous worldwide release, supported by subtitling and/or dubbing in 30 languages.
Given not just the success of Fallout and HBOâs The Last of Us but the acclaim and ratings bestowed on FXâs mostly Japanese-language ShÅgun, this seems like a clever, opportunistic move from Amazon. To the point: âThe unfettered appeal for Japanese content from within Japan and other parts of the world has been growing exponentially,â said James Farrell, head of international originals at Amazon MGM studios.
Itâs not the first adaptation the Yakuza series has had, though â the first game was adapted into a typically anarchic movie by Takashi Miike in 2007.",https://www.polygon.com/24171051/like-a-dragon-yakuza-show-amazon-prime-video-release-date,2024-06-04 13:05:56
"Diablo 4 never had enough treasure goblins. Next week, that changes","Diablo 4 is definitely on the right track after its current season, titled Loot Reborn, made sweeping revisions to the item game of Blizzardâs flagship action role-playing game. But it still lags behind its predecessors in a few areas, one of them being its relative lack of treasure goblins â those little cackling guys with sacks of stolen gold and loot who inspire frantic chases around the map to slay them before they teleport away, often with a comedic conga line of monsters in tow.
Treasure goblins rule. You canât have enough treasure goblins. Diablo 3 introduced the ability to follow them back through a portal to their own loot-filled realm, The Vault, where you could battle a boss called Baroness Greed for even more goodies. How great is that?
The good news is that Diablo 4 is about to get much more treasure-goblin-centric. The bad news is that itâs only happening for a week.
To celebrate the gameâs first anniversary, Blizzard is running an event called March of the Goblins from June 6-13. During the event, thereâll be more treasure goblins running around, their bags will be stuffed with more loot, and thereâll also be a greater incidence of greed shrines, which cause monsters (including treasure goblins) to drop even more gold when activated. Treasure goblins will appear in dungeons in pairs, or even larger packs.
As another nod to Diablo 4âs first birthday, all players will get a Motherâs Blessing buff that increases XP gain by 25% and gold rewards by 50%. Blizzard said the buff would last 10 days, although it wasnât precise about the dates. Thereâll also be some free cosmetics to claim from the shop.
Thereâll be a similar March of the Goblins event, as well as other bonuses, in mobile game Diablo Immortal, which coincidentally celebrates its second anniversary at the same time.
Goblins all round. Get âem while theyâre hot!

Venom: The Last Dance trailer picks up after all those wacky multiverse post-credits teases,"Venom 3, cheekily subtitled the The Last Dance, looks like a splashy payoff to one of the superhero movie eraâs weirder franchises. Tom Hardy is back as Eddie Brock and on the run from some gun-toting scientists who believe the Venom symbiote must be eradicated for the sake of Earth. Crossing my fingers this is The Fugitive / Midnight Run with a Venom horse.
Venom: The Last Dance appears to pick up where we left Eddie and Venom in Venom: Let There Be Carnage: lying low in the tropics after killing serial killer Cletus and leaving detective Mulligan (Stephen Graham) infected with his own symbiote. But if you are a total dork about this stuff, you might be wondering: Hey, didnât Eddie and Venom cross over into the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a post-credits tease at the end of Let There Be Carnage? Yes, they did! At least thatâs what appeared to happen, a theoretical connection to Doctor Strangeâs multiversal spell in Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
But in the end, only Andrew Garfieldâs and Tobey Maguireâs previous Spider-Mans showed up in the crossover movie â no Venom. In fact, Marvel went so far as to undo the whole tease. A post-credits scene in No Way Home saw Eddie grumbling at a bar over his multiverse displacement, only to be immediately transported back to his walled-off Sony-Marvel timeline in a flash. Nothing mattered! Wild.
So here we are, The Last Dance, with Eddie and Venom back where they started: on the run, biting heads, and amped for more black-goo hijinks. There are some out-there rumors on dubious corners of the internet that Eddie might somehow might be on the hunt for a 10-year-old Peter Parker, but the trailer pretty much dispels the post-credits-inspired hope. We do get a tease of Mulliganâs transformation into Toxin, and while Chiwetel Ejiofor shows up as a big bad, heâs not playing Karl Mordo from Doctor Strange â just some dude in army fatigues who likely bonds with a symbiote for a final fight. Ted Lassoâs Juno Temple is also in the cast, and is also rumored to do some symbioting. 
Venom: The Last Dance, which does not take place in the MCU timeline, is out on Oct. 25.

"Tianaâs Bayou Adventure looks better than Splash Mountain, see for yourself","Tianaâs Bayou Adventure has finally replaced Splash Mountain at Disney World. The Disney Parks YouTube account is celebrating the completion of this unprecedented transformation with a nearly 10-minute, 4K ride-through. 
Our first impression? Holy moly, they actually pulled this off!
The rideâs designers had to walk a tightrope while reimagining one of the biggest rides â in terms of scale and popularity â at Disneyâs theme parks. They would need to maintain (or improve upon) Splash Mountainâs abundance of animatronic characters, representing the classic approach to Disneyâs most iconic rides. But theyâd also have to incorporate modern technology (ultra high-resolution screens, custom 3D animation) for Bayou Adventure to fit alongside the parksâ other new âE-ticket attractions,â like Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance and Mickey & Minnieâs Runaway Railway.
In a decision that will please the most nostalgic among us, the design team favored the old-school approach, stuffing the ride with an astonishing number of animatronic characters. They used screens to supplement the experience, like the powdered sugar on a delicious beignet. 
As with Splash Mountain, the ride has a relaxed start. On a log flume, the guests take a leisurely tour of Tianaâs garden and the nearby bayou, before collecting animal instrumentalists to play a tune at the Disney Princessâ restaurant. First, the riders meet a zydeco band featuring possums, beavers, bears, and wolves. Then, the voodoo priestess Mama Odie shrinks riders to the size of a frog so they can tour a mini version of the bayou and befriend some musically gifted bugs and amphibian friends.
The ride culminates, as promised by its premise, with a performance by Tiana at her restaurant, accompanied by her animal orchestra. By our count, this humongous space features no fewer than 15 animatronics, a re-creation of Tianaâs restaurant, and a wealth of high-res screens featuring additional characters from the film, reimagined from 2D into 3D.
Splash Mountain, based on the 1946 film Song of the South, opened at Magic Kingdom in 1992, despite Disney having never released the film on home video in the U.S. due to its racist portrayal of life on a plantation in the Southern United States. In 2023, Scout Tafoya wrote about Disneyâs long history of attempting to alter or erase the history of Song of the South, and the companyâs treatment of the film like a cultural artifact that has become toxic with changing sensibilities. âBut even in its day,â Tafoya wrote, âSong of the South was derided as racist pandering, and it faced a nationwide attempt at a boycott.â
In 2020, Disney announced that Splash Mountain would be replaced by a ride inspired by 2009âs The Princess and the Frog.
Tianaâs Bayou Adventure opens at Walt Disney World on June 28 and later this year at Disneyland. Polygon will be touring the ride ahead of its opening, so come back soon for firsthand impressions and interviews!",https://www.polygon.com/24169416/tianas-bayou-adventure-pov-video-4k-ride-through,2024-06-01 17:31:26
Lara Croft roars in the first trailer for Netflixâs Tomb Raider anime,"Netflixâs new Tomb Raider animated series will debut this October, the streaming company announced Saturday with a new trailer for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. That trailer also teases what Laraâs new post-Survivor trilogy story will be about: a globetrotting adventure in search of a stolen artifact, naturally.
According to Netflixâs official synopsis for the animated series, Lara Croft âhas abandoned her friends to embark on increasingly more perilous solo adventures. But she must return home when a dangerous and powerful Chinese artifact is stolen from Croft Manor by a thief with an uncanny personal connection.â On her journey, Lara will âconfront her true self, and decide just what kind of hero she wants to becomeâ in Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft.
The new series is set after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the final chapter in Crystal Dynamicsâ Survivor video game trilogy â and seemingly before the events of Lara Croftâs next Tomb Raider game.
Powerhouse Animation, the studio behind Netflixâs Castlevania and Master of the Universe: Revelation, is producing Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. Hayley Atwell (Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Captain America: The First Avenger) will voice Lara Croft in the new series. Atwell will be joined by Allen Maldonado (The Wonder Years) as Zip and Earl Baylon, who reprises his role as Jonah Maiava from the Tomb Raider video games.
In addition to Netflixâs new animated series, Amazon is developing a live-action Tomb Raider series with the help of writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fleabag, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny). The next Tomb Raider video game is in development at Crystal Dynamics, and will be published by Amazon and run on Unreal Engine 5.
Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft premieres on Netflix on Oct. 10.

"Everything we know about Infinity Nikki, the upcoming fashion RPG produced by a BOTW alum","Thursdayâs PlayStation State of Play kicked off the fleet of direct-to-player showcases happening this June with several long-awaited trailers and updates, including a first look at gameplay for Infinity Nikki â a fashion-themed open-world RPG that expands on the characters from the popular mobile games, including Love Nikki and Shining Nikki.
The game doesnât have a release date yet, but developer Papergames announced at State of Play that testing will begin in Q3 of 2024. The trailer includes tons of elements to get excited about: incredibly sharp AAA-level graphics, whimsical settings and costumes, and pastel-washed puzzles and challenges. Plus the game will be available on PS5 as soon as itâs released.
But folks might be even more excited about Infinity Nikki after watching clips from IGN reporter Daniel Robsonâs three-hour demo of the game. Robsonâs preview includes tons of exciting artwork and cutscenes from the game, but the glowing review of the gameplay is what will likely get both Legend of Zelda players and Love Nikki fans excited to get their hands on this for themselves.
Robson says players will be able to customize the lead characterâs outfits to a degree that rivals Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and then use a high-powered in-game camera to shoot cute photos of them. Youâll have plenty of opportunities to enjoy the sun-bleached landscape (as Robson calls it âHyrule as interpreted by Studio Ghibliâ) from your perch on a magical glider, ride your bike through the countryside, and use your tools to catch materials for crafting new clothes and items.
The cheek-pinching cuteness of the game doesnât take away from its weight as a challenging and engaging game, though (a dynamic other cozy open-worlds often suffer from, in my opinion). Robson reports that the Zelda-like puzzles and âshrinesâ are challenging without being frustrating, and well worth the payoff at the end â stunning animations that show off the level youâve just beat. 
Thereâs also some combat, including battles with monsters and other creatures that drop materials you can use to sketch and craft new outfits. The game will also eventually include online features, but IGN reported they wonât be available at launch.
As aforementioned, Infinity Nikki developers say itâll be ready for testing around July 2024, and itâll debut on PS5 at launch. IGN previously reported that the game will also be available on PC, Xbox Series X, iOS, and Android, but the developers havenât released an official full list of consoles.",https://www.polygon.com/24168858/love-nikki-infinity-fashion-rpg-papergames,2024-05-31 21:20:37
EA Sports College Football 25âs unique features make it look like way more than a Madden reskin,"Summer is only just starting, but college football fans are already itching to head back to campus in EA Sports College Football 25. The upcoming game marks the franchiseâs return after over 10 years of absence, and will be the first game in the series to feature officially licensed player likenesses, thanks to NIL money and a large-scale campaign to pay players to appear in the game. On Friday, EA released a massive deep-dive into the gameâs ridiculous number of new features, and the ways it aims to create the most realistic college football experience ever, both on and off the field. 
With real players in the game for the first time, many of College Football 25âs new features put an emphasis on making it clear what separates the best players in the sport from everyone else. The game includes a variety of players traits that will augment gameplay, like responding better to high pressure situations and being able to identify on-coming blitzers. There will be more than 80 of these traits in the game at launch, as well as different tiers for each one. 
The game will also feature an extensive new injury system called Wear and Tear, which shows the specific injury effects of each play, and how much it increases a playerâs risk of injury. While this is important during games, itâs even more important in modes like Dynasty, where you run an entire college football program and have to look after your players from game to game. 
One of the ways the game appears to be a major departure from the Madden franchise is also true of college football versus the NFL: Thereâs way more variety in playbooks. College Football 25 already seems pretty dedicated to preserving the individuality and quirks of the 134 schools in the game. Thereâs a detailed option system in the game, including a Flexbone formation with Air Forceâs signature triple option. Thereâs a new feature which lets players pull the ball back and run with it in the middle of a called reverse, and EA even highlights a wide formation, a staple for Oklahoma. 
EA also takes time to note how important real-life tradition is to the presentation of games in College Football 25. Every stadium and fan base in college football has their own unique rituals, and EA has tried to capture as many of those as they can for the game, licensing certain songs for team walkout music (though not every song could be secured), and including fan traditions like Tennesseeâs checkered stadium and Penn Stateâs âWhite Outâ. All of this is in service of not just recreating the authentic highs of a college home game, but also to enhance the gameâs new emphasis on home field advantage, with the ridiculously loud stadiums making it harder for the away team to concentrate on things like calling hot routes.
These are just a few of the new features EA Sports announced for the game on Friday. To get a look at more of the features, EA has put together a short gameplay video narrated by sportscaster Kirk Herbstreit, as well as a very in-depth blog post that outlines each of the gameâs new systems in great detail. 
EA Sports College Football 25 is set for release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on July 19.",https://www.polygon.com/24168832/ea-sports-college-football-25-new-features-like-madden,2024-05-31 19:01:01
Return to Silent Hill will be a movie adaptation of Silent Hill 2,"Silent Hill is coming back to the movies. Details on the upcoming new Silent Hill movie sequel have been sparse since it was announced in 2022, but during Thursdayâs Silent Hill Transmission livestream, a short behind-the-scenes video revealed some new details, and gave us our best look yet at director Christophe Gansâ take on adapting the story of Silent Hill 2.  The livestream also featured an extended gameplay sequence from the upcoming video game remake of Silent Hill 2.
The movie, called Return to Silent Hill, will closely mirror the story of the second Silent Hill game according to Gans. That means it will follow James Sunderland, played in the movie by War Horseâs Jeremy Irvine, as he ventures to the town of Silent Hill in search of his lost love, Mary. But when he gets there, he finds it transformed into something dark and terrible. Or as Gans puts it, âItâs become something like hell.â
The livestream video is mostly on-set footage narrated by Gans, but even without the benefits of post-production, Return to Silent Hill is already looking pretty great. Part of that is thanks to Gansâ insistence, once again, that every monster possible is by played by a human â more specifically, a dancer. Gans explains that this was his approach on the original movie from 2006 as well, and that he finds that these performers give the monsters an otherworldly, inhuman style of movement thatâs both beautiful and unsettling. And based on the footage of the dancers in Thursdayâs video, even without the monster make up, heâs definitely right.
In the past, Gans has also explained that Return to Silent Hill will not be a direct sequel to his original movie, Silent Hill, or its sequel, Silent Hill: Revelation, which was directed by M.J. Bassett. Instead, Gans says to think of these movies more like an anthology series, where each entry can tell its own unique story in the Silent Hill universe without worrying too much about the previous movies. In fact, Gans has explained that he drew quite a bit of inspiration for the film from concept art for P.T. as well as Silent Hill 2.
Thereâs no word yet on when Return to Silent Hill will hit movie theaters. The video game remake of Silent Hill 2 will be released on Oct. 8.

Now we know what Monster Hunter Wilds looks like in action,"Capcom has circled back to reveal more about Monster Hunter Wilds, the open-world entry in its beloved Monster Hunter series, after having previously revealed the game at The Game Awards 2023. At PlayStation State of Play on Thursday, a new gameplay trailer showed off way more of this massive upcoming title. Thereâs still no release date â besides just â2025â â but now we know a bit more about how the game looks.
The new gameplay trailer introduced what appears to be an ensemble cast of characters, trading quips amongst one another while riding a big boat that somehow is traveling over the sand dunes of a huge desert. A series of shots then depicts these characters exploring a diverse range of environments that are â you guessed it â full of monsters. The trailer then showed some classic-looking Monster Hunter battles, with over-the-shoulder shots of a character who has a vast array of weapons at their disposal.
The Monster Hunter franchise, which celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2024, is comprised of dozens of wildly successful games across every platform â even the tabletop. The bestselling entry in the franchise, Monster Hunter: World (2018), was a huge action-adventure game but didnât actually feature an open-world â despite the âWorldâ in its title. Its follow-up, Monster Hunter: Rise (2021), followed the same formula. Since Monster Hunter Wilds will have a fully open world, fans can expect more freewheeling exploration through much bigger maps and biomes.
We still donât know exactly when in 2025 weâll be exploring the world of Monster Hunter Wilds, but we do know the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.",https://www.polygon.com/24168014/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-gameplay-trailer-state-of-play,2024-05-30 22:53:00
Every big announcement from PlayStationâs new State of Play ,"Sonyâs latest State of Play livestream was full of new game announcements and updates for all things PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR 2 â with a little bit of PlayStation content for PC as well. PlayStation fans got a look at a new game starring the lovable Astro Bot, a new Dynasty Warriors, a release date for the Silent Hill 2 remake, and confirmation of a few games making the jump from PC to PS5 (and vice versa).
If you couldnât watch Mayâs big State of Play showcase live, hereâs a recap of all the game announcements, release dates, trailers, and other highlights from Sonyâs event.
When Sony showed off Concord at last yearâs PlayStation Showcase, we didnât know what to expect from Firewalk Studiosâ multiplayer PvP FPS. Now we do, as Sony and Firewalk showed off a cinematic trailer and in-engine gameplay from the colorful 5v5 competitive hero shooter starring a bunch of alien misfit adventurers. Concord is coming to PS5 and PC on Aug. 23.
Kratos and Atreusâ latest adventure makes the leap to Windows PC this year. God of War RagnarÃ¶k, originally released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 in 2022, will get its long-awaited Windows port on Sept. 19, with all the bells and whistles weâve come to expect from Sonyâs PC efforts. That includes super ultrawide display support and Nvidia DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.1, and Intel XESS 1.3. RagnarÃ¶k on PC will also include the gameâs Valhalla DLC.
The star of Astroâs Playroom and Astro Bot Rescue Mission returns for a brand-new game coming to PlayStation 5 later this year from developer Team Asobi. Itâs called, simply, Astro Bot, and like Astroâs Playroom, itâs steeped in love of all things PlayStation. Astro can transform into PlayStationâs most famous characters, including Kratos, Aloy, and Nathan Drake, and even turn into a PlayStation 5 console. Astro Bot hits the PS5 on Sept. 6.
Marvel and NetEaseâs team-based hero shooter starring the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe is coming to PS5. Marvel Rivals is currently in closed testing on PC, with console versions slated to arrive later this year. A console beta test will be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X in July.
Capcom and Sony gave us a new look at Monster Hunter Wilds, the 2025 open-world follow-up to Monster Hunter: World, in a new gameplay-focused trailer.
Konami and Bloober Teamâs remake of early aughts horror classic Silent Hill 2 now has a release date. Silent Hill 2 is coming to PS5 on Oct. 8. A spooky new trailer shows what to expect from the new rendition.
Koei Tecmo and Omega Force havenât released a new mainline entry in the historical hack-and-slash Dynasty Warriors franchise since 2018. Thatâs about to change with Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which is coming to PS5 in 2025. (Itâs also coming to Windows PC and Xbox Series X.)
Grinding Gear Gamesâ Path of Exile 2, the studioâs next iteration of its free-to-play action RPG, is coming to PS5 as well as PC. The alternative to Diablo 4 is set years after the original Path of Exile, sending players to the dark world of Wraeclast where theyâll seek to end a spreading corruption. Early access starts on PS5 sometime this fall.
Supermassive Gamesâ interactive horror game Until Dawn comes to PS5 and Windows PC this fall, new and improved. At State of Play, we got a look at what remaster studio Ballistic Moon has brought to the 2015 original.
You may remember Where Winds Meet from Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022, where the ambitious, Wuxia-style open-world action-RPG was revealed. Where Winds Meet is now confirmed for PS5, with a new gameplay trailer to show off the goods.
Open-world dress-up adventure Infinity Nikki is coming to PS5 â with a beta test expected soon â letting players explore a bucolic fantasy world with their furry friend Momo. Think Breath of the Wild, but with really cute outfits.
The developer behind Pascalâs Wager revealed its new game, Ballad of Antara, a very ambitious Soulslike action game coming to PS5 in 2025. According to the gameâs official description, âA faraway land is on the verge of being lost to a conflict from eons ago, and the invasion that followed it. Embark on a perilous journey, seek towering divine creatures, to reclaim the twisted and lost fundamentals of the world.â
Alien: Rogue Incursion is an âintense single-player, action horror gameâ â and the first Alien game developed especially for virtual reality â coming to PlayStation VR 2 from developer Survios this holiday season.
Skydanceâs Behemoth promises an adventure through strange, otherworldly environments and battles against towering monsters, with âweighty VR combat and life-like physics.â PSVR 2 owners will be able to test those claims for themselves when Behemoth arrives later this year.

"Marvel Rivals is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X","Marvel and NetEase Gamesâ superhero team-based PVP shooter Marvel Rivals got announced last March and is already in beta on PC. At the PlayStation State of Play livestream on Thursday, fans learned that the game will also be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, with a closed beta coming to the PlayStation platform soon.
Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play game with a huge lineup of Marvel heroes and villains, with 18 characters confirmed thus far: Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Groot, Hulk, Iron Man, Loki, Luna Snow, Magik, Magneto, Mantis, Namor, Peni Parker, Rocket Raccoon, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, Storm, Star-Lord, and The Punisher. The premise revolves around converging timelines and multiple Doctor Dooms, with proceedings overseen by Galactusâ daughter Galacta, but really the point of Marvel Rivals is to see these popular and mega-powerful characters teaming up and using their diverse array of abilities in combat.
In an earlier interview with Polygon about Marvel Rivals, game director Thaddeus Sasser â who has also worked on series like Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Ghost Recon for two decades â emphasized that all of those different superpowers are definitely the fun part. âHaving magical superpowers in a multiplayer game is something that hasnât really been done to death,â he said. âItâs still kind of relatively fresh and new, and the way weâre doing it, and some of the tricks weâve got up our sleeves should be pretty exciting for new players.â",https://www.polygon.com/24168146/marvel-rivals-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-state-of-play-release-date,2024-05-30 22:27:59
"The next Minecraft update adds trials chambers, due to arrive June 13","The next Minecraft update is on the way, and itâs called Tricky Trials. Tricky Trials is set to launch on June 13 for both the Bedrock and Java versions of the game, and as you may have guessed from the name, itâs about creating new challenges for the player. There are also new decorations, a new mace weapon, and an auto-crafter powered by redstone.
As part of this update, players will be able to discover trial chambers, which are full of hostile mobs. There are two new creatures that can be encountered here. The first is the breeze, a fast-moving tornado that might just send you airborne. Then thereâs the bogged, which are poisonous skeletons ridden with moss and mushrooms. 
The challenge trials will be tricky, but the rewards are well worth it â and players can scale the difficulty up by exploring one with friends by their side. Every player gets to claim rewards from the chamberâs vault, and there will be plenty of cosmetics around to break down and bring home to decorate a base with.
If you want to turn the difficulty up even further, players can find and choose to chug an ominous bottle. Doing so applies a status effect called Bad Omen. This means that entering an overworld village will trigger an ominous raid, and entering a trial chamber with Bad Omen starts an ominous trial. These challenges have stronger enemies with enchanted weapons â and defeating them can also reward you with the items you need to build a new mace.

League of Legends fans are flabbergasted at a new $500 Ahri skin,"League of Legends is free to play, but Riot Games makes money off in-client purchases. If youâre a fan of a specific champion, you can purchase alternate cosmetic skins with new lore. In the mainline lore, Ahri is a nine-tailed fox looking to find the secrets of her people... but with skins, she can be an international star, an evil witch in the woods, or a magical girl squad captain. One new skin has raised a furor among fans, because at its top tier, it costs a whopping $500.
Riot has started a new initiative to honor the best of the best of the League of Legends esports scene in the Hall of Legends, a commemorative list of the gameâs greatest figures. The first player to be inducted is an obvious choice: Faker, a multi-time world champion widely considered to be the GOAT. The Hall of Legends comes with an in-game pass, with 100 levels of unlockable rewards. This includes a Risen Legend LeBlanc skin, a ward, banner, and other emotes and icons.
The second skin associated with Faker is the one garnering all the controversy. There are three tiers of Ahri skins: Risen Legend, Immortalized Legend, and the Signature Immortalized Legend. These skins can only be unlocked through collections, and the Signature Immortalized Legend Collection is 59260 RP, which is equivalent to around $500. It comes with banners, borders, Fakerâs signature on the splash art, a complete event pass, and in-game upgrades to Immortalized Legend Ahri.
Thatâs a hefty price tag, and understandably, fans are shocked. âSorry to my rioter friends but riot is absolutely batshit with this, NO digital cosmetic is worth 30K or 60K RP. None. Faker is NOT that cool bro,â wrote one player on X. Another player posted a Discord convo, in which one participant asks: âDoes it come with a fucking handjob from Ahri herself?â
sorry to my rioter friends but riot is absolutely batshit with this, NO digital cosmetic is worth 30k or 60k rp. None. Faker is NOT that cool bro. and none of the money from these bundles is going to be used to improve league in any meaningful way. lol. rofl. lmfao. https://t.co/oH3cdLVxyr
Other fans noted that itâs ironic to have such an expensive skin to honor Faker, as the player is known to play without any skins. There have been esports skins in the past, but none have ever hit this price tier â and even with their comparatively modest prices, Faker has stated that he waits to purchase skins like SKT T1 Ryze when theyâre on sale. Itâs hard to see the value behind a macrotransaction such as this, especially when $500 could purchase a full console, or several incredible triple-A games. Some fans have joked that theyâll start permanently banning Ahri from their games, ensuring that no one can use the skin, no matter how much it costs.
She said it, not me   pic.twitter.com/PTZJnVa8aI
âgo to hellâ is basic. âi hope your favorite league champion gets a $400 skinâ is smart. itâs possible. itâs terrifying.
This gave me an ideaWhen the Ahri skin comes out there should be a pact that in every single game, at least one of the teams bans AhriI think this will be for the greater good https://t.co/K9mszhbOuB
Ahri is a popular champion, and Faker is an icon of League of Legends, but the price point has many fans outraged. Polygon contacted Riot for comment, but did not receive any additional information. It remains to be seen how many superfans pony up for this purchase â and if they end up catching any heat from the rest of the playerbase.

"Dungeons & Dragons is coming to Destiny 2, turning your Warlock into a Mindflayer","Bungie increasingly loves pop culture crossovers for Destiny 2, and the new Dungeons & Dragons-inspired cosmetics coming to the game feel like a natural fit for the shooter. Sure, the Beholder-inspired Ghost shell may be a bit of a stretch, but when weâre getting a Mindflayer set for Warlocks, can we really complain?
Destiny 2âs new Dungeons & Dragons collaboration will drop on June 4, the same day the new expansion The Final Shape arrives, officially. The D&D collab includes FaerÃ»n-inspired looks including the aforementioned Flayerâs Dominion set for Warlocks, Apex Draconic set for Titans, and Spectral Displacer set for Hunters. An Adventurerâs Pack bundle will include a Queen of Dragons (aka Tiamat) ship, the Owlbear Chariot Sparrow, and the Eye Tyrant Ghost shell.
Hereâs a closer look at some of those cosmetics:
Guardians can also equip the Bigbyâs Fist finisher and the Natural 20 emote â which rolls a 20-sided die for random rolls â as part of the crossover. All that stuff will be available in Destiny 2âs Eververse store.
Bungieâs been leaning in on bringing other fantasy and sci-fi properties to Destiny 2 in recent years, including cosmetics based on The Witcher, Mass Effect, and PlayStation games The Last of Us, Horizon: Zero Dawn, God of War, and Ghost of Tsushima. The Fortnite-ification of Destiny 2 also extended in the opposite direction, with Destiny crossovers for Fortnite itself and competitive bean game Fall Guys.
When it arrives next week, Destiny 2: The Final Shape will serve as a narrative end to the War of Light and Darkness, and bring with it a new advanced subclass, a new destination, and a new campaign. Some Destiny fans on PlayStation platforms have already gotten their hands on The Final Shape, unintentionally, as a portion of the expansionâs content was âaccidentally pushed live on PS5âs streaming service,â Bungie said.

Netflix is making a Minecraft animated series,"Netflix and Mojang Studios are bringing Minecraft to streaming as a new CG-animated series, the companies announced Thursday. The Minecraft series will feature an original story with new characters, Netflix said in a news release, âshowing the world of Minecraft in a new light.â
In a brief announcement that coincides with Minecraftâs 15th anniversary, Netflix pitched the animated series as a pairing of the âbest selling game of all time [and] the biggest streamer in the world.â Minecraft has sold more than 300 million copies, and spawned multiple spinoff games, since officially launching in 2011. Netflix recently announced it had reached nearly 270 million subscribers worldwide.
Animation studio WildBrain, who have developed Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego for Netflix, is behind the new Minecraft animated series. Beyond that, Netflix and Mojang didnât provide much in the way of detail.
Netflix previously featured Minecraft as part of its offerings, with the 2018 release of Minecraft: Story Mode. That narrative game, developed by the original Telltale Games, was first released in 2015, and brought to Netflix a few years later. Minecraft: Story Mode was removed from Netflix in late 2022.
Minecraft is also being adapted into a live-action movie. The Minecraft movie will star Jack Black (The Super Mario Bros. Movie), as Steve, alongside actors Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Danielle Brooks (Peacemaker), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). The Minecraft movie is set for an April 4, 2025 release date.",https://www.polygon.com/24167807/minecraft-netflix-animated-series-tv-show,2024-05-30 13:20:30

The latest Silent Hill Transmission will stream on May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT/7 p.m. EDT. You can watch it on the official Silent Hill YouTube channel.
The previous Silent Hill Transmission aired in 2022, and during that event, Konami revealed a long list of projects based on the Silent Hill franchise. That includes the remake of fan-favorite Silent Hill 2 from Bloober Team; a brand-new entry in the series called Silent Hill f; and Silent Hill: Townfall, a new game made in partnership with publisher Annapurna Interactive and developer No Code (Stories Untold, Observation).
Konami and its partners have released two Silent Hill projects since that 2022 livestream: Silent Hill: Ascension, a chaotic, crowdsourced interactive streaming series, and Silent Hill: The Short Message, a free game released for PlayStation 5. 
Still to come is Christophe Gansâ promised return to directing a Silent Hill movie. Gansâ new movie, Return to Silent Hill, will closely follow the plot of Silent Hill 2, telling the story of James Sunderlandâs tortured journey to the titular town to reunite with his late wife Mary. Actors Jeremy Irvine (War Horse) and Hannah Emily Anderson (Jigsaw) will star respectively as James and âhis one true love.â Anderson will likely portray both Jamesâ wife Mary Shepherd-Sunderland and her mysterious doppelganger Maria.",https://www.polygon.com/24166622/silent-hill-transmission-may-2024-konami-remake-movie,2024-05-30 13:20:00
Wildermythâs studio will conclude the game with its final expansion ,"Wildermyth is an incredible procedurally generated RPG that leads players through a series of narrative quests. As you build bases, battle foes, and learn more about the world, youâre able to build up your cast with new decisions and sacrifices. A hero might die, marry another party member and have children, or turn into an increasingly feral beast. Itâs a tremendously cozy, satisfying RPG experience. 
Wildermyth has a core campaign, and additional adventurers that introduce new stories and new enemy factions. The gameâs first DLC pack was focused around new cosmetic skins and armors for heroes, whereas the upcoming Omenroad expansion includes a roguelike-style challenge mode and a new story campaign called Walk in the Unlight. While Omenroad brings lots of new bosses and challenging fights, it also represents an end to development for Wildermyth. Worldwalker Games announced the conclusion on May 29 on the gameâs official X account.
âWe will continue to support the game and fix critical bugs, but donât expect new content going forward,â co-owner Nate Austin wrote. âWe will be saying farewell to many of our team members. Worldwalker Games is going into hibernation for now.â
An important update on things at Worldwalker Games pic.twitter.com/SXUbqAJxPy
Austin clarifies that the team still intends to port Wildermyth to other platforms, and the hibernation does not affect that âin any way.â He also commits to continuing a Kickstarter that will record the gameâs music live and integrate it into the game, French and Spanish translations for Omenroad, and to maintain the gameâs Discord, wiki, support email, merch store, and social media.
âWildermyth has been wonderful, but nothing goes on forever,â wrote Austin. âWe wanted to ship Omenroad, and having done that, weâre ready to move on. This was the plan, and it doesnât have anything to do with how well Omenroad is doing. (Itâs doing well! Weâre extremely proud of it.)â
He added, âIâm pretty sure weâll eventually find something else to pour our passion into, and weâll let you know about it when the time comes.â
Itâs sad to see an end to Wildermyth, which has become one of my staples when I want to play a narrative RPG adventure. But itâs also a tremendous game, and itâs good to see the studio end on a high note and walk away from the project of their own choice. While we may never see another title from the Worldwalker team, Iâll treasure Wildermyth and the stories it effortlessly spins for years to come.",https://www.polygon.com/2024/5/29/24167458/wildermyth-final-expansion-game-ending,2024-05-29 22:07:36
"Tom Bombadil, cut from Lord of the Rings movies, to step out in Rings of Power","The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is doing what no Lord of the Rings adaptation has done before: putting Tom Bombadil in the thing. 
Rory Kinnear (Black Mirror) will play the puissant and pacifistic character in season 2 of the Prime Video series, Vanity Fair revealed on Wednesday. With a few months ahead of its Aug. 29 premiere date, showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay were ready to explain how and why they brought the oft-overlooked Tolkien character to the screen. 
To fans of J.R.R. Tolkienâs The Lord of the Rings, Tom Bombadil is divisive out of proportion to his prominence. The linchpin of a three-chapter digression early in the pages of The Fellowship of the Ring, Tom rescues Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin from an intelligent and malicious tree known as Old Man Willow and takes them back to his house to meet his wife. But also, heâs apparently so powerful that the One Ring has no effect on him. 
Tom is neither hobbit nor human, nor dwarven, nor elven. He says that heâs older than the existence of rivers, and trees, and paths. Though he has Gandalfâs deep respect, heâs not a wizard, and aside from saving the hobbitsâ lives a couple times, he has no interest in weighing in on the Ring Quest. But also heâs cheerful, has a big bushy beard, wears a funny hat, and he constantly spouts almost nonsensical rhyming couplets.
Itâs that mystery and dichotomy that made Payne and McKay interested in bringing him into The Rings of Power, despite his canonical appearances being limited to those few chapters in The Fellowship of the Ring. 
âTom Bombadil is singing and saying lines that could be nursery rhymes from childrenâs poems,â Payne told Vanity Fair. âSo he sort of defies the tonal shift of the rest of the season and is a real point of light amidst an otherwise sea of darkness.â 
Payne and McKayâs Bombadil is concerned with the fate of natural life on Middle-earth: âIn our story, he has gone out to the lands of RhÃ»n,â said Payne, âwhich we learn used to be sort of Edenic and green and beautiful, but now is sort of a dead wasteland.â This isnât a big stretch for a figure who soothes angry trees and married the daughter of a river, but in Rings of Power, heâll drop some cryptically-put advice to Stranger, who may or may not be an amnesiac Gandalf, instead of a group of hobbits.
âHe nudges the Stranger along his journey, which he knows will eventually protect the larger natural world that he cares about. So Iâd say our Tom Bombadil is slightly more interventionist than you see in the books, but only by 5% or 10%,â Payne said.
For decades, casual readers have puzzled over Tomâs place in the Lord of the Rings, but the truth is that the character is something of a relic of the origin of Tolkienâs high fantasy trilogy as a simple sequel to his episodic adventure for children, The Hobbit. Tolkien wrote Tom, a figure originally invented to entertain his children, into the story before he had even conceived of Aragornâs kingly destiny, or that Sauron was the ultimate antagonist, or that Frodoâs name shouldnât be âBingo Baggins.â
So why did Tom stay in, through all processes of revision? 
âTom Bombadil is not an important person â to the narrative,â Tolkien once wrote to his proofreader for The Lord of the Rings. âI suppose he has some importance as a âcomment.â I mean, I do not really write like that... He represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyze the feeling precisely.â
Tolkien was an academic specializing in Old English and Scandinavian languages, one who held a lifelong fascination for the folklore, mythology, legends, and epic poetry of those regions. His fiction is a constant mix and remix of stories he invented for his children, fairy tales, Norse myth, Arthuriana, epic poetry like Beowulf, and other references, allusions, and motifs familiar pretty much only to other academics in his field. 
Tom Bombadil began as a cameo for his children, but he stayed in the story because he made it feel more like Tolkienâs favorite kind of stories. Tolkien just liked what Tom Bombadil contributed to the vibe â and so does The Rings of Power, apparently.

MK1âs first Homelander gameplay trailer shows why we love to hate The Boysâ superman,"Vought International superman and breast milk enthusiast Homelander is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 on June 4, and in the new combatantâs first gameplay trailer we get to see some familiar sights from The Boys. That includes Homelander bisecting his enemies â specifically Sub-Zero â with powerful eye lasers, and sending hundreds of commercial airline passengers to their deaths, in this case by throwing Liu Kang through a jet engine.
Mortal Kombat 1âs take on Homelander looks faithful to the onscreen version played by actor Antony Starr (who has said heâs not voicing the supervillain in this DLC). We see him pull a few signature Homelander moves, like a deafening ear clap and casually launching his opponent into the upper atmosphere. Like another Kombat Pack character in MK1, Omni-Man, Homelander hovers and flies throughout his fights, rushing down his opponents with super speed.
In Homelanderâs first gameplay, heâs paired with Ferra, the soon-to-be-released Kameo Fighter. Mortal Kombat fans will fondly remember Ferra as the partner of Torr from Mortal Kombat X. Sheâll behave much like she did in the past, serving as a spritely combat partner who can be thrown as a projectile when needed. In addition to Homelanderâs two Fatalities shown here, we also get a look at Ferraâs: another split-down-the-middle finisher.
Homelander and Ferra are part of MK1âs Kombat Pack add-on, which has also brought the following characters to the gameâs roster: Quan Chi, DCâs Peacemaker, Invincibleâs Omni-Man, and Ermac. The sixth post-launch fighter included in the Kombat Pack is Takeda Takahashi, who arrives sometime this summer. Five Kameo Fighters are also included in the Kombat Pack: Tremor, Ferra, Janet Cage, Khameleon, and Mavado.
Mortal Kombat 1âs Kombat Pack, on sale for $15.99 now through Sunday, is also included as part of the Premium Edition of the game, which costs $109.99.
Prime Videoâs The Boys returns for a fourth season on June 13.",https://www.polygon.com/24043196/mk1-homelander-gameplay-fatality-mortal-kombat,2024-05-29 14:21:00
Moana 2 trailer brings me a new best friend ,"Moana 2! Itâs happening! Moana is back, and so is Maui, but beyond that... the first couple of teaser trailers have given absolutely no plot information beyond the fact Moana will be sailing on the ocean. This time, with some more characters! 
What the new Moana teaser does give fans of the 2024 original, however, is some glimpses of new creatures. And there is one creature that stands out: THIS HUGE WHALE SHARK FRIEND! 
Maybe itâs not a friend? I donât care. I see a whale shark and the only thought in my mind is can I pet it? Hopefully the directors of Moana 2 took notes from Avatar: The Way of Waterâs tulkun and Moana can speak to the big watery friend via a psychic link.
Anyway BIG WHALE SHARK FRIEND (!!!!!!) aside, thereâs not much plot info beyond some other cool new creatures, a few more characters in the background, and some quips from Maui.
Maybe the official synopsis will help?
Moana 2 reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything sheâs ever faced.
... or not! Mysterious! The gist with this Moana sequel is that it was originally supposed to be a Disney Plus series. But in the grand tradition of the DTV era of the early 2000s, the TV show was retooled into a movie. Hopefully itâs more seamless than Atlantis: Miloâs Return (the bar is low, and yet). 
Dwayne âThe Rockâ Johnson and AuliÊ»i Cravalho will reprise their roles as Maui and Moana. Unlike the first movie, which featured music from Lin-Manuel Miranda (Hamilton, Encanto), the sequelâs music will be composed by Grammy winners Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear (The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical), composer and Grammy nominee Opetaia Foaâi, and three-time Grammy-winning film composer Mark Mancina. Moana 2 will be directed by David Derrick Jr., who previously worked as a storyboard artist on Raya and the Last Dragon and Encanto. This sequel is not the live-action Moana, which is still in development.
Moana 2 sails into theaters on Nov. 27.

Emma Robertsâ NASA rom-com is the Legally Blonde of astronaut movies,"In 2013, NASA had its first class of potential astronauts made up of 50% female candidates, and when director Liz W. Garcia (Purple Hearts) read that fact she had a lot of thoughts. 
âI was surprised that it had taken so long, but also pleased that weâd finally gotten there, and I was moved to look into what it takes to become an astronaut candidate,â she told Polygon over email. âOnce I learned how astonishingly competitive it is to even get to the point that youâre being considered, I knew I wanted to set a movie in that world, because itâs so extreme.â
Space Cadet, out July 4 on Prime Video, follows a Florida party girl named Rex (Emma Roberts, Madame Web) who dreams of going to space. She doesnât have the proper credentials, but with the help of her best friend (Poppy Liu, American Born Chinese) she embellishes her resume a little and somehow lands a spot in NASAâs astronaut training program. 
Sheâs so determined to see the stars that sheâs able to impress the program directors (played by Gabrielle Union, Bring It On, and Tom Hooper, The Umbrella Academy). But how long will she be able to keep up her less-than-factual resume and experience? 
âLike in Legally Blonde or Private Benjamin, I was excited to show a heroine who was underestimated and who had none of the cut-throat, pedigreed qualities we typically associate with elite success, but whose very down-to-earth, inclusive, feminine (!) approach would ultimately be what made her so good at the task at hand,â Garcia said. âItâs a feel-good movie about the world as Iâd like it to be, where doors are open to everyone and women are celebrated.â ",https://www.polygon.com/24164032/space-cadet-emma-roberts-legally-blonde-director,2024-05-29 13:00:00
Disneyâs Star Wars hotel Galactic Starcruiser was torpedoed by bad app design,"Earlier in May, filmmaker and critic Jenny Nicholson released the four-hour YouTube documentary The Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel. The video has since commanded nearly 6 million views, and spawned dozens of follow-up thinkpieces, ranging from fervent hand-wringing over the diminished nature of the modern theme park experience, to critics arguing against the continued commercial viability of the Star Wars brand itself, to genuine surprise at consumer appetite for long-form video content on YouTube. I personally donât have a lot to add to the discourse, other than this: Nicholson is right about the app. There was no hope for the hotel with that app. 
I was there, Gandalf, during an abbreviated tour of Galactic Starcruiser hosted by Disney Parks in February 2022. As I made clear in my review of the Star Wars hotel, Polygon was invited to the four-hour event on Disneyâs dime. In fact, you can see footage from the very same tour that I was on around the two-hour mark in Nicholsonâs video.
At no time during that junket were the many influencers or the handful of press present on board the Galactic Starcruiser, known as the Halcyon, given access to the Datapad app. Instead, the junket was verbally annotated by Disneyâs tour guides as though we had been using the app all along. Cast members directed us to certain in-fiction events and performances as though we had been welcomed into those spaces by the app. But Nicholsonâs investigation, based on her own firsthand account of the full experience as well as anecdotal reports posted on social media by dozens of other guests, paint a damning picture of a piece of software that simply didnât work as intended. 
The Galactic Starcruiser Datapad, itself baked into the larger My Disney Experience app, was supposed to be the conduit that connected guests to the storyline of their choice during their stay at the Star Wars hotel. In practice, however, itâs clear that the app only worked some of the time. As a result, a significant portion of the guests that attended the (at minimum) roughly $5,000 two-day experience were set adrift, left untethered from whatever levers were available to the staff on site to properly involve them in the goings-on aboard the starship. The only solution for some guests was to step outside the fiction, pick up the phone or get in line with a customer service representative at the hotel, and complain the old-fashioned way.
What killed Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser? I donât think it was the presence of Rey and Kylo Ren or any of the other trappings of the modern-day trilogy. And I donât think it was the dearth of engaging things to do at the Star Wars: Galaxyâs Edge theme park either, although that probably didnât help matters much. What ultimately torpedoed the Star Wars hotel was bad app design, a buggy piece of software that was never quite up to the task.
Sadly, the Star Wars hotel is no more. The Halcyon took guests on a final voyage last year in September. Itâs a shame, because some of the performances â especially those involving Rey and her allies in the Resistance â were extraordinary. Thereâs clearly only so much heavy lifting that a dedicated team of actors can do when the digital director driving the action fails as spectacularly as the Datapad app did here.",https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24166456/disney-star-wars-hotel-video-galactic-starcruiser-jenny-nicholson-bad-app,2024-05-28 21:06:08
The Sims 4âs next kits focus on poolside luxury and cozy bistro dining,"The next The Sims 4 kits are all about resting and relaxing. Thereâs plenty of DLC for The Sims 4, which ranges from big, game-changing expansions to smaller and more aesthetically focused kits. With the Riviera Retreat and Cozy Bistro kits, players will be able to create new poolside set-ups, or customize a cozy bistro to their tastes.
The pool used to be a much scarier spot for Sims to hang out, back in the days when players could simply delete a ladder and watch their Sims haplessly drown. Now, they can pull themselves out by themselves. The Riviera Retreat kit is all about creating archways, stucco tiles, wicker lounge chairs, and vine-covered pergolas. This is a great way to create a little vacation resort in your Simâs backyard, especially for players who donât want to pack up and go on vacation in another game world.
Meanwhile, the Cozy Bistro kit is meant to create a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Sims can start their own restaurant business, employing chefs and setting the price. It can be a little tough to create specialized restaurants without using some of the kits available, since so much of the base furniture is designed for a residential home. Or, you could customize your own home kitchen with these bistro tables and vintage wall decor, depending on your Simâs business savvy.
These two kits will be available on May 30 for all platforms on The Sims 4 Gallery, which includes custom builds and rooms created by other players. Weâre still waiting for solid news on the eventual The Sims 5, which is currently code-named Project Rene. But while we wait for concrete details to emerge on the sequel, Electronic Arts is continuing to support The Sims 4 with DLC, including these kits.

Uvalde parents and school shooting victims  sue Activision,"Families of victims killed and injured in an Uvalde, Texas school shooting are suing Meta and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare publisher Activision Blizzard for promoting guns to kids. â[Activision is] chewing up alienated teenage boys and spitting out mass shooters,â attorney Katherine Mesner-Hage wrote in the complaint filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court.
Activision is being targeted as an alleged âtraining camp for mass shooters,â while attorneys call out Meta and Instagram as âthe firearm industryâs best advertiser.â The Uvalde victims and their families are also suing Daniel Defense, whose AR-15 style rifle was used by 17-year-old Salvador Ramos to kill 21 people and injure 17 others at Robb Elementary School on May 24, 2022, in a separate lawsuit also filed Friday. Daniel Defenseâs DDM4v7 rifle, which the Uvalde victimsâ lawyer called âan upscale version of the AR-15,â was highlighted on Call of Duty: Modern Warfareâs opening title page while also being promoted on Instagram by Daniel Defense. Ramos purchased that weapon minutes after his 18th birthday, which was eight days before the shooting at Robb Elementary School.
The lawyer wrote that Ramos was not a casual Call of Duty player, saying he âplayed obsessively, developed skill as a marksman, and obtained rewardsâ in the game that required him to âgrind for hours on end.â Before downloading Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2021, he played several other versions of the game, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and Call of Duty: Mobile. Mesner-Hage alleges that Ramos was introduced to the DDM4v7 rifle simultaneously through Call of Duty and on Instagram. Ramos also allegedly searched for other accessories inspired by video games â âa Red Dot Sight, a smoke grenade, an AR-15 weapon skin, and an EOTech holographic battle sight.â
The lawsuit also included several gruesome details of the attack, including that Ramos approached a teacher and said âgood night,â before shooting her in the head â something Mesner-Hage said is something longtime Call of Duty character Captain Price is known to say in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and other games.
âThere is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting.  Just 23 minutes after midnight on his 18th birthday, the Uvalde shooter bought an AR-15 made by a company with a market share of less than one percent,â attorney Josh Koskoff wrote in a news release. âWhy? Because, well before he was old enough to purchase it, he was targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense. This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it.â
An Activision spokesperson told Polygon that academic and scientific research shows âno causal linkâ between video games and violence. âThe Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence,â the spokesperson said. âAcademic and scientific research continues to show that there is no causal link between video games and gun violence.â
But the Uvalde victimsâ lawyers disagree, pointing to the evolving realism of Call of Dutyâs weapons as a marketing tool for gun manufacturers. They also referenced at least five other mass shootings in which Call of Duty was allegedly linked to shooters, one of which was a shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas. After that shooting, Walmart instructed its employees to remove signage referencing violent video games and hunting from its store, but did not stop selling guns. 
Indeed, researchers havenât found a causal link between playing video games and gun violence; the Stanford Brainstorm Lab spent months reviewing all scholarship related to the topic, according to Fortune. There was some link to vaguely described âaggression,â which encompassed a range of actions. These studies still didnât find a causal link between games and violence, the researchers wrote. Certain video game communities have, however, been linked to right-wing extremism in the United States.
Itâs true, too, that video games have licensed weapon likenesses for video games; Electronic Arts dropped the practice in 2013, for instance, but still uses the same types of guns â just without the names. âIt is hard to qualify to what extent rifle sales have increased as a result of being in games,â Ralph Vaughn of Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, whose M82 sniper rifle has appeared in Call of Duty games, told Eurogamer in 2013. âBut video games expose our brand to a young audience who are considered possible future owners.â ",https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit,2024-05-28 17:44:38
Nintendo and Lego reveal $300 Great Deku Tree set,"Nintendo and Legoâs Great Deku Tree set is a two-in-one homage to two incredible Zelda games: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The $300 kit includes 2,500 pieces that allow you to build a Great Deku Tree scene from either of the iconic games.
âIn addition to the Great Deku Tree, the set comprises iconic sceneries from the video games including the Master Sword pedestal from Breath of the Wild, as well as Linkâs House from Ocarina of Time, allowing enthusiasts freedom to customise their display,â Lego said in a news release. âThe build is elegantly mounted on stands, providing an effortless showcase of the set.â

    Related
  
Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said Nintendo wanted the Deku Tree as the first Zelda set represented in Lego. Hereâs how Lego and Nintendo describe the duality of the set:
Notably, both builds offer interactive features. In the Breath of the Wild rendition, the Great Deku Treeâs face can be animated with the simple press of a lever, while the Ocarina of Time Great Deku Tree version boasts a captivating mechanism: when activated, its mouth opens, revealing a cleverly designed Skulltula (a spider-like enemy from the games) that descends into its depths.
In the Breath of the Wild version, enthusiasts will marvel at the Great Deku Tree adorned in vibrant pink blossoms, accompanied by the iconic Master Sword pedestal. Notably, this rendition boasts an engaging feature: the ability to animate the treeâs expressive eyebrows and mouth, adding depth to the build.
Meanwhile, in the Ocarina of Time version, builders will encounter a lush green foliage-adorned Great Deku Tree. This version includes Linkâs House, a pivotal element tied to the Ocarina of Time narrative, adding an extra layer of nostalgia and authenticity to the set. Itâs worth mentioning that regardless of which version you choose to build, you will have the ability to construct both the Master Sword pedestal and Linkâs House as smaller models.
The set includes four minifigures: Link and Princess Zelda in their Breath of the Wild outfits, alongside young Link and Link from Ocarina of Time. There are also buildable characters like Hestu the Korok and his Korok pals, Deku Babas, Navi, the Deku Sprout, and a Skulltula.
The Great Deku Tree kit is expected to ship on Sept. 1, but pre-orders are open already. At $299.99, itâs a pricey kit â but the level of detail seemingly makes the cost worth it. With this kit, Nintendo continues its expansive partnership with Lego; so far, Legoâs created nearly 30 Super Mario Bros. kits, as well as Animal Crossing: New Horizon sets and classic consoles, too.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 confirmed day one on Game Pass in new trailer,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the next major entry in Activisionâs enduring military shooter franchise, will be available as part of Microsoftâs Game Pass subscription service from day one, a new trailer for the game confirms. While said trailer does not appear to include any actual gameplay from this yearâs Call of Duty, it does offer the promise of much more info, which is coming on June 9.
Thatâs the Sunday when Activisionâs new owner Microsoft will hold its 2024 Xbox Games Showcase â which will be followed by another presentation, the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct. Activision promises an âin-depth look at gameplay in this dark new chapter of the Black Ops seriesâ as part of that Call of Duty livestream.
For now, Call of Duty fans will have to settle for uncanny lookalikes and soundalikes of former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush, former secretary of state Colin Powell,  former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and former president of Iraq Saddam Hussein. Those political figures will play an important role in the setting of Black Ops 6, which takes place during the Gulf War.
Previous Black Ops games have featured real-world U.S. presidents, including John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon in the original Call of Duty: Black Ops, and Ronald Reagan in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. How players will interact with those early â90s politicians remains to be seen, but weâll find out more about the next Call of Duty soon enough.
Activision and Black Ops developer Treyarch have been teasing their new Call of Duty in recent days, primarily with â90s nostalgia-laden videos that set the stage for the Gulf War-era setting of Black Ops 6.

PlayStation Plusâ June 2024 lineup gives us Segaâs best beat-âem-up,"PlayStation Plus subscribersâ free Essential games for the month of June are SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake, AEW Fight Forever, and Streets of Rage 4, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced Tuesday. Players can download the trio of games beginning Tuesday, June 4.
Sony revealed June 2024âs monthly free PS Plus games as part of a larger Days of Play announcement, in which the company promised deals on PlayStation hardware and games, as well as bonus titles for the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog. Days of Play 2024 runs from May 29 through June 12.
Juneâs free monthly games for PS Plus Essential kick off with SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake, the platformer adventure game in which SpongeBob and Patrick get wish-granting â and reality-shredding â Mermaidâs Tears. The duo don a variety of themed costumes to conquer medieval, Western, and prehistoric worlds. 
AEW Fight Forever is the wrestling arcade-style game that lets players mix it up as All Elite Wrestling superstars or play as their own customized wrestler. Itâs the only place to get your Exploding Barbed Wire Death match fix on PlayStation this summer. 
Streets of Rage 4 is the must-play side-scrolling belt-action beat-âem-up from Sega and developers LizardCube, Guard Crush, and DotEmu. Streets of Rage 4 revitalized the Genesis-era franchise with the return of fan-favorite characters, great music, and combo-focused gameplay. As Polygon editor in chief Chris Plante said in his review of the 2020 game, âStreets of Rage 4 is everything I could have wanted from a true Streets of Rage sequel. Iâm satiated.â
PlayStation Plus subscribers can still pick up Mayâs PlayStation Plus Essential games â EA Sports FC 24, Ghostrunner 2, Tunic, and Destiny 2: Lightfall â through June 3. (Actually, soccer fans can grab EAâs FIFA replacement through June 18.)

When will Furiosa come to streaming?,"The Mad Max franchise is back in theaters with Furiosa, and itâs exactly the kind of massive, gorgeously made movie thatâs perfect for the big screen. But that doesnât mean we arenât excited to see Furiosa at home. Between all the bombastic action and the incredible stunts, itâs a movie well worth pausing and rewinding a few times. So hereâs everything we know so far about when you can stream the movie at home. 
Furiosa will likely hit streaming sooner than you think. While the movieâs poised to do pretty well at the box office, itâs also produced by Warner Bros., a company thatâs been willing to get movies on VOD pretty quickly over the couple of years. 
Dune: Part Two is the studioâs most comparable recent movie, and it arrived on streaming on April 16, about six weeks after it was released in theaters. With that in mind, Furiosa could arrive on home platforms to own or rent as soon as July 9, or even earlier if the more crowded summer blockbuster season forces it out of theaters earlier. 
As for when it will arrive on streaming platforms, that will take a little longer. Dune: Part Two arrived on Max on May 21, nearly two months after its release. If Furiosa keeps a similar timeline, it would likely be available on Max around the end of August or the Beginning of September. 
Furiosa will be on Max, Warner Bros. in-house streaming service, at least for its initial streaming release. But, since Warner has recently started licensing some of its biggest movies to Netflix, thereâs a good chance it ends up there sometime in the near future. 
Mad Max: Fury Road is already streaming on Max, and it makes for perfect post-Furiosa viewing.",https://www.polygon.com/24162843/furiosa-when-stream-max-watch-home,2024-05-26 18:07:44
"Rian Johnson has a new Knives Out mystery coming, and weâre going to solve it right now","Rian Johnson, that sly devil, has done it again: Heâs gone off and made another mystery in the series that began in 2019 with Knives Out and continued in 2022 with Glass Onion. The director has promised that Daniel Craigâs effete sleuth Benoit Blanc will return in a new whodunnit next year, and that itâs called Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. But you know what? Donât bother, Monsieur Blanc. We can solve this one right now. We have all the clues. 
Consider: The announcement teaser, which shows no footage, but features the previous title cards in the lead-up to the reveal of the new film title. Leading us there is this little trinket, a magnifying glass with a knifeâs blade instead of a handle. 
Or is itâ¦ the weapon of murder?! Will the killer in Wake Up Dead Man (Arnold Schwarzenegger, I have no doubt) use this to fry his victim (Richard Kind, very upsetting), in an elaborate death trap, like a cruel child scorching an ant? Itâs more likely than you think! I bring your attention to exhibit B, Johnsonâs X post about the new movie:
I love everything about whodunnits, but one of the things I love most is how malleable the genre is. Thereâs a whole tonal spectrum from Carr to Christie, and getting to explore that range is one of the most exciting things about making Benoit Blanc movies.
This makes my horrifying thesis plausible. Here, Johnson is signaling a tonal pivot for Wake Up Dead Man, and the gothic typeface of its title card suggests it will be a spooky pivot. Richard Kindâs horrible, nightmare-inducing death will be preceded by a red herring, Schwarzeneggerâs faked death at the hands of Gisele BÃ¼ndchen, in her first feature film role since The Devil Wears Prada. She, however, will believe she murdered Arnold accidentally, and spend the movie being haunted by various ghosts (played by Megan Thee Stallion, Tig Notaro, and, controversially, an AI recreation of Eminem, which is confusing because they couldâve just asked). 
And Benoit Blanc, of course, will spend the entire film puzzling over a Ouija board and writing an original musical. Weâll think this is vital to solving the case, but in fact, he already knew the answer. Itâs what they call a shaggy-dog story. Well played, Rian. 
But if you still want to make this movie, I guess Iâll see it. Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery does not have a release date yet, but the teaser says itâll come to Netflix in 2025.",https://www.polygon.com/24163990/knives-out-3-wake-up-dead-man-announced-rian-johnson,2024-05-24 16:10:13
"Did you watch Gal Gadotâs Heart of Stone? Because tons of Netflix subscribers did, apparently","In the wake of the WGA union contract negotiation last fall, which demanded greater transparency over what was getting watched on streaming services, the typically secretive Netflix opted to start sharing viewership numbers on a regular basis. âThis has been on a continuum for several years,â co-CEO Ted Sarandos told Variety last December, suggesting the streamerâs first ever âWhat We Watchedâ engagement report was just its way of playing catch up and not at all about being held accountable by the industry. Sure, Jan, etc.
The initial report revealed just how essential licensed TV and movies remained to a platform that was proudly spending oodles on original content. The story to be found in the second report issued on Thursday, which breaks down viewership and streaming hours in both film and television categories from July through December 2023, is more about the surprises: things one might assume were blockbuster hits for the streamer were more like modest wins, while less obvious projects apparently scored big. Also, Gal Gadot is a Netflix star.
Did you see Heart of Stone when it dropped last August? Slick action movie starring Gadot as super spy [checks] Rachel Stone? Not a movie that comes up a lot in conversation. (For what itâs worth, we dug it well enough thanks to some fairly savvy stunts.) But despite its lack of cultural footprint, the latest from the studio and star that brought you Red Notice was a pretty notable hit for Netflix; according to the engagement report, 109.6 million people viewed the movie in the first five months on the platform. That outranks movies like Leo, the down-the-middle kidâs flick starring Adam Sandler, David Fincherâs The Killer, and even the holiday-timed platform release of Super Mario. Oh, and 27 million people also caught up with Red Notice â the Heart of Stone effect is real!!
There was an even bigger winner for Netflix as far as movie output is concerned: the apocalyptic chamber drama Leave the World Behind, starring Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali, which garnered 121 million views without an action movie price tag. Both Leave the World Behind and Heart of Stone trounced what was supposed to be Netflixâs giant holiday blockbuster, Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire, which rounded out at 57.8 million. While Zack Snyderâs movie might see a bump in the next round of number-crunching thanks to the recent sequel, itâs not a great look to be dominated by 2017âs The Boss Baby in the charts.
On the TV side, no one series was able to eclipse the hit movies based on pure viewership, but there do appear to be winners. Unlike Netflixâs previous live-action anime experiment, Cowboy Bebop, viewers actually showed up for One Piece, which clocked 541.9 million hours of view time in its first season (against 71.6 million views). Compare that to The Witcher season 3, a marquee series that appears to have struggled with only 363.8 million hours (and 47.9 million views). Netflixâs TV chart also saw wins from non-fiction and international programming â with Korean series making up nine percent of the total viewership across the entire platform. 
There are tons of wild stats in the engagement report and plenty of conclusions to be made as the streaming industry enters its cost-cutting, bundle-chasing, corporate-strategy-shake-up era. You can read the entire report on Netflixâs corporate site.

The 5 biggest announcements from Warhammer Skulls 2024,"Warhammer Skulls is an annual convention that focuses on announcements and updates for the various video games under the Warhammer umbrella. Thereâs a surprising variety of video games in this catalog, especially since Warhammer refers to both the fantasy and sci-fi settings of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, Age of Sigmar, and Warhammer 40K. While some fun Easter eggs and crossovers were announced, the event also featured some pretty hefty announcements. Here are the five biggest news stories out of this yearâs Warhammer Skulls.
Rogue Trader is a massive CRPG, and while it had its fair share of bugs and balance issues, developer Owlcat Games has spent the time since launch ironing those wrinkles out. A new 15-hour campaign is on the way, integrated with the main story. The expansion, called Void Shadows, largely takes place on the the von Valancius war-ship. 
Players can meet (and possibly romance) Death Cult assassin Kibellah, coordinate with new high-level officers, build a new hangar for void combat, and uncover a xenos conspiracy aboard their ship. Owlcat also announced that Rogue Trader will now be supported on Steam Deck, which makes playing through this massive game much easier â or much more mobile.
Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus is a solid, if somewhat underappreciated XCOM-style strategy game. Today, Kasedo Games and Bulwark studios announced that there will be a sequel, Mechanicus 2, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. While the first game only let players take the role of the tech priests of the machine cult known as the Adeptus Mechanicus, the sequel allows players to take the side of the ancient machines known as Necrons.
Mechanicus 2 will have multiple campaigns, taking place around the awakening of a Necron tomb world. The playerâs choices determine the ultimate outcome of the war, with Black Library writer Ben Counter helming the narrative. While this sequel was unexpected, itâs certainly a pleasant surprise.
Warhammer 40,000: Darktide takes place in the bowels of a hive city, pitting rejects pulled straight from jail against the endless tides of the disease godâs minions. The next update will arrive on June 25, and itâs called Secrets of the Machine God. The update includes new weapons and a new mission, where players explore an abandoned Mechanicus research station.
The update will also include a new event called Hestiaâs Decollation Crusade. Players will be asked to eliminate the generals commanding swarms of heretics, in exchange for in-game currencies.
For those who prefer squashing rats in a fantasy setting, Fatsharkâs other co-op horde shooter game is also getting an update. Vermintide 2 will receive a quality-of-life update with lots of changes: a new loadout system, changes to Chaos Wastes and the Winds of Magic, weekly expeditions, updates to the Chest of Trials, 30 new boons, and more.
Vermintide 2 is also launching an in-game event that will run from May 23 to June 9, during which players can earn time-limited rewards. Fatshark is debuting the first playable boss on test servers, which are charmingly called Returning Alpha Test â or RAT. Players who are interested in trying out the Bile Troll boss fight can join those test servers between May 30 and June 9.
Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive shared a new trailer showing off the multiplayer modes available in Space Marine 2, which is currently set to be released on Sept. 9. Players can tackle the campaign as a team in the three-player co-op mode, allowing their friends to take the role of Titusâ supplementary Ultramarines.
The PvP game mode from the first Space Marine is set to return as well, with three 6v6 game types called Annihilation, Seize Ground, and Capture and Control. The co-op elements of the game will have classes; for instance, the stealthy Sniper has a camo cloak, whereas the tanky Bulwark uses a combat shield on the front lines. There are also some fun customization options, allowing players to make their own custom chapter of Space Marines.
Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is a charming, bloody boomer shooter that I enjoyed more than I expected, and Auroch Digital has now revealed a new expansion to the game. Forges of Corruption includes new environments, enemies, and weapons. Players can pick up a new edition of Boltgun that includes the Forges of Corruption content, or they can buy the DLC separately. Forges of Corruption will launch on June 18, along with a free horde mode update, a navigation guide to prevent players from getting lost, and various bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.

Frogger: Walkable City asks what a frog might do in a city free of cars,"Frogger is a simple, classic title that has stood the test of time. The player controls the titular frog, just trying to get home. In order to get there, the frog has to jump across logs, dodge alligators, and try not to end up as roadkill while crossing a busy highway. But what if there were no cars? What if our friendly frog could simply amble through a 15-minute city, planned to allow for bike paths, pedestrian walkways, and public transit? Woe Industries, the developer behind experiments like Myth FPS and Dr. Mario Insurance, is brave enough to ask that question. 
Frogger: Walkable City is a 45-minute fan game created with RPG Maker. In a world without cars, the frog is able to freely explore. At first, everything seems to be peaceful and tranquil. I stop to chat with someone outside the farmerâs market, and they proudly tell me they can host this farmerâs market 24/7 thanks to a successful civic planning system. Kids scamper around a playground, celebrating their freedom in a city safely designed to meet their needs. Sure, thereâs a stranger in a cloak who warns you about a hidden section of the bar, but itâs probably fine.
The more I explore, the stranger things get. I donât want to spoil the fun, but within a few minutes of my first playthrough, I stumbled across a mini-mart. The nice young man behind the counter told me there was a coffee shop downstairs, so I went to check it out. Dear reader, I regret to inform you that there was no coffee shop â just a cavern full of blood goblins. It seems you can take the cars out of the city, but you canât take the turn-based combat out of the RPG Maker game. Luckily, Frogger is equipped with a folding chair and tongue slap, which allows me to vanquish these new foes.
You can play Frogger: Walkable City in your browser, and itâs worth a shot â itâs a wildly weird little game, perfectly suited for the transit-oriented gamers among us.

Dave the Diverâs Godzilla DLC will only be around for a limited time,"Dave the Diver, the weird and wonderful fishing and restaurant management game from 2023, has new Godzilla downloadable content out today: Godzilla is invading the Blue Hole. Yes, the kaiju Godzilla, all teeth and fire. Itâs a free DLC pack for people that already own Dave the Diver on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, or Windows PC via Steam. The only catch is that youâre only able to download it until Nov. 23 â a six month period.
Why? Thatâs not entirely clear, but my best guess is that itâs due to the licensing of the big monster. (Weâve reached out to developer Mintrocket for clarification.) But as long as you download it before then, youâre good.
The Godzilla DLC brings both Godzilla and a big lobster Kaiju to Dave the Diver. Youâll at least fight Ebirah in a submarine-based battle. And yes, Godzilla and Ebirah will fight. It looks to be a short, but engaged addition much like the Dredge crossover content that was released in December last year. (Dredge, like Dave the Diver, is a fishing game from 2023, but with a grotesque, spooky spin. The Dredge DLC in Dave the Diver added a bunch of Dredgeâs weird fish.) Beyond the lobster battle, youâll also be able to find monster figures hidden throughout the Blue Hole.
If you havenât already tried Dave the Diver, you should. Itâs so much more than just a fishing game and restaurant management sim: The deeper you go, the larger the secrets. Last year, it earned the 12th spot on our games of the year list.
Correction: This story originally called Ebirah an original kaiju, when itâs actually part of the Godzilla universe. Weâve updated this story to reflect that information.",https://www.polygon.com/24163213/dave-the-diver-godzilla-dlc-limited-time-release,2024-05-23 15:47:40
What to know about George Millerâs post-Furiosa plans for the Mad Max series,"After nearly a decade between trips to the Wasteland (i.e., Australia), director George Miller has re-emerged with the latest entry in the Mad Max Saga, Furiosa. The excellent new movie fills us in on the backstory of the best character in Mad Max: Fury Road, and shows us how exactly she came to be driving a war rig full of wives in the seriesâ fourth entry. 
But just because Millerâs latest movie isnât focused on Max doesnât mean his storyâs over. Hereâs everything we know about where the Mad Max franchise is heading next, how the seriesâ biggest hero will return for its next entry, and the question people always wonder about when theyâre sitting in the theater after the action stops.
Nope, just like Mad Max: Fury Road before it, Furiosa does not have a post-credits scene. (There is a single, split-second close-up shot of a wildly bobbling piece of vehicle dÃ©cor, but no characters or dialogue, and it flashes by in barely a breath.) But the end credits do include some flashes of the best scenes from Fury Road. So technically, if youâd like a fuller post-credits experience, you can just go watch Fury Road as soon as Furiosa ends. 
There will be â at least, thatâs what George Miller hopes. Miller already has plans for the next movie, titled Mad Max: The Wasteland, and will likely make it if Furiosa is a box-office success.
In the long break between Mad Mad Beyond Thunderdome in 1985 and Mad Max: Fury Road in 2015, George Miller spent a lot of time thinking about the story of the Wasteland. He created the story and script for Fury Road, a backstory for Furiosa that was so detailed, it nearly became an anime series, and backgrounds for just about every random character you can think of, including the Doof Warrior. 
But the other thing he did was co-write, along with Nico Lathouris (his Fury Road and Furiosa writing partner), a novella about Mad Maxâs time in the desert before the events of Fury Road. This is likely what the next movie in the series would be about. So weâd be getting another prequel â but if any movie deserves a variety of prequels, itâs probably Mad Max: Fury Road. 
Yes, but that project seems awfully far away right now. In an interview with Digital Spy, Miller explained that while his next project will be a prequel focused on Max, heâs spent some time thinking about what happens after Furiosa takes over the Citadel, too. But that project will have to wait in line, and since it took him almost a decade to make Furiosa after Fury Road, itâs probably best not to hold your breath.

MultiVersusâ Batman is still Kevin Conroy âfor the foreseeable futureâ,"Earlier this month, MultiVersus developer Player First Games announced a new PvE mode for its fighting game. That mode, called Rifts, will feature unique battle scenarios and minigames, as well as cinematics and story elements, the developer says. It will be updated seasonally with new content.
Weâll see characters interact in mode-specific ways in Rifts, and Player First promises to keep adding to the PvE mode season to season. With a fully voiced cast featuring the talents of John Dimaggio, Matthew Lillard, Tara Strong, and others, the game will bring a long list of beloved characters together for some first-of-their-kind interactions.
One notable issue the developers face is the death of Kevin Conroy, the iconic voice of Batman and Bruce Wayne in animated features and video games. In MultiVersus, Conroy is reunited with fellow Batman: The Animated Series actor Mark Hamill, the famous voice of the Joker. In an interview with Player First Games co-founder and MultiVersus game director Tony Huynh, I asked him how the studio plans to approach future content featuring Batman in the wake of Conroyâs passing.
âKevin Conroy was a big part of my childhood,â Huynh told me before addressing the issue, âand Batman is my favorite fictional character, period. Kevinâs passing really affected me personally. And I think that the pairing of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy in our game is special.
âI actually donât know what weâre gonna do going forward. We have to figure that out. No matter what though, we want to be respectful of Kevin and the legacy that he left behind. A big reason why, I think, Mark Hamill is in the game is because Kevin is as well. So Kevin is extremely important to our game, and the work that heâs done for our game will persist. Going forward, I donât know fully what weâre going to be doing. We do plan on updating the game regularly and have to come up with plan for that, but that isnât finalized yet.â
A representative for Warner Bros. Games added that âthere was a lot of voiceover work that was doneâ by Conroy, âso, for the foreseeable future, thatâs who Batman will be in MultiVersus.â
MultiVersus will return, with many new additions, on May 28. The free-to-play game will be available once again on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.",https://www.polygon.com/24162612/multiversus-pve-rifts-batman-kevin-conroy-death,2024-05-23 13:10:00
"Strange Horticulture sequel announced, deals in antiquities instead of plants","Strange Horticulture is getting a sequel, developer Bad Viking and publisher Iceberg Interactive announced Thursday. Folks, weâre heading back to Undermere. Strange Antiquities is set several years after Strange Horticulture, swapping plants for âarcane artefacts.â Thereâs no release date just yet, but Iâm eager to dive back into the occult world.
Like in Strange Horticulture, youâll take over a quaint, mysterious shop with unusual items that may help or hinder the locals. Outside of open hours, youâll be able to explore Undermere and collect new antiquities. Of course, you must pet the shopâs cat. The story begins with a mystery: Hundreds of ravens begin circling above the town. Hereâs how Bad Viking describes it:
As the Thaumaturgeâs apprentice, youâll be tasked with running a shop dealing in mysterious antiques, but when hundreds of ravens start circling over the town of Undermere, those in the know become concerned. Occult Scholar Verona Green plans to visit Strange Antiquities to inquire about this unnatural turn of events, however, before she can meet with you, things take a sinister turn...
Bad Viking founders John Donkin and Rob Donkin told Polygon via email that theyâve pulled their approach to puzzles from Strange Horticulture into Strange Antiquities. âOne thing we noticed that people loved in Strange Horticulture was that all the puzzles make sense in the environment in which we present them,â the duo said. âIt allows you to get fully absorbed in the world and your role in it, and that has been our approach again with Strange Antiquities. We never cram in a puzzle just for the sake of it, and the theme serves as a guide for what goes into the game. Itâs the kind of restriction that really helps focus the design process and hopefully adds to the depth of the world weâre creating.â
They continued: âWe also learned to always include a cat.â
Strange Antiquities is a bigger game, with a bigger shop. John and Rob said theyâve added more reference books to complicate the item identification puzzles, making the game feel more detective-like. âYou might need to look up a symbol or a gemstone, or you might need to use the index in the back of the book to cross-reference against another entry,â they said.
One of the things I loved about Strange Horticulture was the atmosphere. Everything felt right in the weird, dimly lit plant shop. That environment will be important, once again, in Strange Antiquities. John and Rob said the atmosphere is a mixture of the gameâs different elements: ânarrative tone, artwork, animation, lighting, sound, and probably a bunch of other things.â The simple setup â with the game largely in one location â means the atmosphere is essential.
âWe think it also helps to have a very clear vision of what it is we want to create,â Rob and John said. âWe recently came across this quote from Thomas De Quincey, which delightfully sums up what weâre aiming for: âSurely everyone is aware of the divine pleasures which attend a wintry fireside; candles at four oâclock, warm hearthrugs, tea, a fair tea-maker, shutters closed, curtains flowing in ample draperies to the floor, whilst the wind and rain are raging audibly without.ââ ",https://www.polygon.com/24162550/strange-horticulture-antiquities-announcement,2024-05-23 13:00:00
The Witcher season 4 teaser proves that Liam Hemsworth sure looks like Geralt,"The biggest question hanging over the upcoming fourth season of Netflixâs The Witcher has, for better or for worse, been about casting. Liam Hemsworth has replaced former Superman Henry Cavill as the monster hunter Geralt of Rivia for the showâs final two seasons, and naturally people want to know how well he slides into that snug leather armor. Netflixâs first season 4 tease is geared towards answering that question, and nothing more. 
The one-minute clip slowly approaches nu-Geralt from behind in a foggy wood, closing in as Hemsworth looks over his shoulder to reveal that hey, he looks like Geralt! This is not that shocking, I suppose, as the people making this show have eyes and probably do want some kind of visual continuity here. Of course, in this very controlled and narrow glimpse, none of his co-stars or familiar haunts are present to register any dissonance, so seeing him â and more importantly, hearing him â in actual action is where the challenge lies. 
As for when weâll see any more, that remains to be seen. Thereâs still no official premiere date for season 4, but considering how the series left Geralt in a pretty pickle last season, itâs hard to object to The Witcherâs creative team taking its time to get our favorite mutated monster slayerâs re-introduction right.

Tom Kingâs Archie one-shot will finally âsolveâ the dilemma of Betty or Veronica,"Archieâs been putting his tough choices off for too long. Itâs finally time for Riverdaleâs favorite son to decide between Betty and Veronica, and thankfully heâll have a special guest writer to help make sure things go smoothly. Legendary comic scribe Tom King, along with artist Dan Parent, will step in for a full-length one-shot called Archie: The Decision, in which Archie finally makes his choice. 
As you might expect for such a landmark moment in Riverdaleâs history, The Decision will feature many of Archie Comicsâ fan-favorite characters, from Josie and the Pussycats to Sabrina the Teenage Witch, all reacting to the decision and sharing their thoughts. 
Kingâs reputation as a writer of the biggest, thinkiest superhero comics of the last decade tends to overshadow the consistent humor in his books. The writer of The Vision, Omega Men, Mister Miracle, Batman, and Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow seems excited to fully embrace Archie-style comedy. 
âAs a massive Archie fan, this is just a pure joy project for me,â King told Polygon via email. âI wanted to do something zany and cool and screwball and hysterical and gorgeous and harebrained and maybe a little tiny itty-bitty bit profound as a tribute to my Golden and Silver Age Archie heroes â people like Dan DeCarlo, Harry Lucey, Bob Bolling, Bob Montana, and Samm Schwartz. And who better to do that with than the modern Archie maestro, Dan Parent, who inherited and brilliantly carried on the legacy of those giants. [The Decision] is an epic, riotous story featuring scores of Archie characters where Dan and I wrestle with the greatest dilemma in the near 85-year history of comics: Betty or Veronica!? Iâm not sure we can solve it, but, like all of Riverdale, weâre going to have a ton of fun trying.â
Archie: The Decision hits shelves on Aug. 28, clocking in at a full 32 all-ages pages. Archie Comics has shared a sneak peek of the issue with Polygon, including a variant cover by Stephen Byrne and one page of the book itself, that you can check out below:

Ubisoftâs new free-to-play shooter XDefiant faces classic launch-day troubles,"People dipping into Ubisoftâs free-to-play arena shooter XDefiant are unable to access matchmaking due to connectivity issues, Ubisoft confirmed Tuesday. âWeâre aware that some players are unable to join a game â please bear with us while we look into servers and matchmaking,â a representative posted from the official X account.
Players are reporting that theyâre endlessly stuck searching for other players before receiving an âUnable to Find Matchâ message. XDefiant officially launched around 1 p.m. EDT, and players almost immediately started facing issues as people flooded to the game. âMatchmaking servers go boom!â XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin posted on X shortly after launch. âWe are working on it.â
Matchmaking servers go boom! We are working on it. pic.twitter.com/8gjk8dASzG
Ubisoftâs later updates suggest XDefiantâs server woes are improving, but it also noted the team is still investigating. The company will continue to update players as progress continues. 

    Related
  
XDefiant is free-to-play, 6v6 shooter that lets people play as one of five factions based off Ubisoft properties: Libertad revolutionaries from Far Cry 6; ex-Ghost Recon specialists known as Phantoms; agents from Splinter Cellâs Echelon spy agency; DedSec street hackers from Watch Dogs; and the Cleaners, former sanitation workers from The Division series. Players can swap factions and weapon loadouts throughout the game, similar to switching characters in Overwatch.
Ubisoft intended to release XDefiant in October 2023, but ended up delaying the game indefinitely. Ubisoft then expected XDefiant to be out by March, which got pushed once again. The company is looking toward XDefiant to bolster its place in the live-service space, according to a February financial report.
Overloaded servers might not sound like the worst problem to have â it typically means a lot of people are trying to play. But a free-to-play game with a bad launch runs the risk of its players moving onto something else, if they canât get in; thereâs no real shortage of other shooters for prospective XDefiant play instead.",https://www.polygon.com/24161951/ubisoft-xdefiant-unable-to-find-match-launch-day-troubles,2024-05-21 20:51:12
Medieval war sim Kingmakers shows what happens when an Abrams tank enters the battle,"As the first Kingmakers gameplay trailer illustrated, an army of heavily armored medieval soldiers is no match for a man from the future armed with a shotgun, grenade launcher, and   sniper rifle. The matchup becomes even more lopsided when you can call in an attack helicopter to strafe an entire battalion into red mist.
A new trailer for Kingmakers answers an equally important question of who would win: a huge medieval castle or an Abrams tank? Yeah, the tank wins in all situations, whether itâs versus Tudor architecture or a company of knights. It appears the latter just becomes hamburger stuck in the treads of that tank. Gruesome stuff. Also, thereâs going to be a lot of virtual horse death in this game, for which I have extremely mixed feelings.
What Kingmakersâ latest trailer is actually intended to illustrate is how well it handles the destruction of buildings, from humble cottages and taverns to towering stone castles. Kingmakers developer Redemption Road promises that these dynamic collapses and explosions all happen in real time, with realistic physics, which will make the shooter-medieval-military-strategy-simulation fun to watch if nothing else.
Kingmakers is due to arrive sometime later this year on Windows PC via Steam.",https://www.polygon.com/24161849/kingmakers-tank-vs-castle-trailer,2024-05-21 18:48:00
Destiny 2âs latest cutscene sets the stage for The Final Shape,"Destiny 2: The Final Shape is less than a month away, and Bungie has officially set the stage with its latest cinematic.
[Warning: This post contains spoilers for the finale mission of Destiny 2: Season of the Wish, which includes a major cutscene that leads into The Final Shape expansion.] 
On Tuesday, Guardians jumped into a new mission that took them into the Black Garden, where the finale of the original Destiny takes place. Upon finishing the mission, players were shown a new cutscene, which sees the return of Cayde-6, the beloved (and long-dead) Hunter Vanguard. 
For some quick context, The Witness â Destiny 2âs biggest bad â created a portal into The Traveler at the end of the Lightfall campaign last year, and itâs been hanging out in there ever since. Guardians have been unable to go inside, as the portal kills anything that gets close. 
However, months ago, the Vanguard decided to allow The Crow to wish his way into The Traveler. The idea here is that, because Crow (formerly prince Uldren) and his sister Queen Mara have such a strong connection, Mara would be able to twist reality in order to help players get inside the portal.
And thatâs where the Destiny 2 story paused for months, thanks to Bungie delaying The Final Shape from February to June.
The cutscene on Tuesday finally pushes the story forward again, as we see Crow tumble out of the portal and into The Traveler itself. Aside from the giant monolith of death looming in the background â The Witnessâ fortress â The Traveler looks picturesque. But Crow hardly has time to take in the sights before getting shot at. 
Veteran players will likely recognize the silhouette of Crowâs attacker almost immediately: Cayde-6, the wisecracking Hunter Vanguard that Prince Uldren executed back in Forsaken. (This was before Guardians then killed Uldren and he was resurrected into a Guardian called The Crow without any of his old memories ... that is until the Hive God Savathun gave Crow Uldrenâs memories in Season of the Lost â a lot has happened in the last six years of Destiny storytelling, OK?)
The cutscene is loaded with fan service, but the real money shot is when we see the reverse of Caydeâs infamous execution, which shows the former Hunter Vanguard standing over Crow and aiming down at him. Cayde, of course, has no idea that this is no longer Uldren, and that his killer has been reborn as a Guardian. As heâs about to pull the trigger, Glint, Crowâs Ghost, reveals himself, causing Cayde-6 to lower his hand cannon.
Cayde helps Crow up and the two share an awkward moment before they both focus on the true task at hand: The Witness. 
This cutscene, frankly, rules, and is the exact kind of thing I was looking for ahead of The Final Shape on June 4. Last yearâs expansion, Lightfall, disappointed a lot of Guardians â myself included â in the story department, so to see something like this leading into what Bungie promises will be the finale of the past 10 years of Destiny is pretty exciting. All thatâs left now is for us to traverse the portal ourselves and retake The Traveler from The Witness.",https://www.polygon.com/24160971/the-final-shape-cutscene-cayde-crow-traveler,2024-05-21 18:38:16
Fortnite is lowkey becoming the go-to place for Lego video gamesÂ ,"Fortnite continues its growth into a platform for experiences beyond the battle royale shooter, and now its adding another Lego game to its roster. Could it start to become the default home for Lego game experiences? On Tuesday, Lego Group and Epic Games released another game to its growing library of games: a space exploration adventure called Lego Smoothie Odyssey. 
Lego Smoothie Odysseyâs name perfectly describes its gameplay. You explore the plastic-y cosmos and collect ingredients to make smoothies that are, shall we say, out of this world. Based on a description of the game, it appears to emphasize exploration and allows players to venture forth into a variety of locales featuring landmarks like ancient caves and bubbling geysers. Its goofy, neon pink and purple worlds perfectly match Fortniteâs aesthetic. 
Prior to all the Lego Fortnite games, Warner Bros. Games served as the main publisher behind a lot of Lego games with licensed IP. This included its most recent release, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga in 2022. Now, Epic Games has become a major purveyor of Lego games. Sony and Lego Group invested $2 billion in Epic Games back in the spring of last year. Now weâre starting to see the fruits of that investment, as the catalog of Lego games on Fortnite grows in number and in scope. 
It started with the Minecraft-esque Lego Fortnite, which paired classic Lego brick building with survival gameplay. Since then Lego Group and Epic Games have continued to expand upon the world in Lego Fortnite, but also release a bunch of other games within the Fortnite launcher. Epic Games released Lego Plane Walkers â a game where you navigate a plane by balancing its wings â on May 16. Just a few months prior, the developers also added three additional games: Lego Cat Island Adventure, Lego Prop Hunt, and Lego Battle Arena and February brought Lego Raft Survival and Lego Obby Fun. Itâs already a lot and this all isnât even considering that the users themselves can create and design their own kinds of Lego games on Fortnite as well. 
Back when I was kid, we played Lego Star Wars games on the Nintendo GameCube. Now people can just download Fortnite for free and get a full catalog of different options with all kinds of gameplay. Itâs pretty sweet arrangement if you happen to be a fan of all things Lego, but only time will tell if any of the games end up resonating in a big way with fans.",https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24161698/fortnite-new-lego-games-free,2024-05-21 17:54:48
"It was a big weekend for fans of Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, 40K, and Necromunda","In advance of the big Warhammer Skulls video game event on May 23, Games Workshop dropped a load of news and updates for just about all of its major tabletop franchises. Hereâs what was revealed recently for Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, Warhammer 40,000, The Horus Heresy, Necromunda, and more.
First announced in March this year, the highly anticipated 4th edition of Warhammer: Age of Sigmar is on its way this summer. On May 17, Games Workshop ripped the cover off a new boxed set titled Skaventide. The massive box include 24 Stormcast Eternals, 50 Skaven ratfolk, and a smattering of terrain. No word yet on the pricing or release date, but more is promised on the Warhammer Community website.
Warhammer 40,000âs beloved Sisters of Battle, also known as the Adepta Sororitas, are getting a bit of a refresh. A new 10th edition Codex was announced alongside a new Battleforce starter army and a smaller format Combat Patrol. Both boxed sets are expected later this year alongside a new Canoness model.
Weâve praised the Genestealer Cults before here at Polygon as one of the most inexpensive ways to get started with Warhammer 40,000, and the little purple critters are back with a vengeance in 2024. A new 10th edition Codex is on the way and, just like the Sororitas above, thatâs being paired with a new Battleforce starter army and a Combat Patrol. Itâs the smaller Combat Patrol box thatâs really turned our heads here since it comes with a standard vehicle, a heavy weapons-enabled quad bike, and no fewer than five cultists on dirtbikes. That should make this one of the most mobile small-unit forces in the game! Pricing and availability are forthcoming, with more information promised in the weeks and months to come.
Warhammer: The Horus Heresy is getting a boatload of new plastic miniatures for the Cult Mechanicum â the first in the history of the line. That includes a dashing, art deco-inspired transport vehicle to ferry them all into battle and the promise of even more unique units to come. Again, no pricing or availability information was shared, but these products are nonetheless expected soon.
Finally, perhaps the biggest news from the weekend is the continued expansion of Games Workshopâs Necromunda universe. Already one of the most vibrant and engaging sectors of âthe hobbyâ as itâs called, Necromunda: Hive Secundus looks for all intents and purposes like a new starter set. Games Workshop is describing it as âa full game in a boxâ however, noting that it contains a linked campaign for two players. Pricing and availability â Say it with me! â will be announced at a later date.",https://www.polygon.com/24161719/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-launch-box-reveal-preview-weekend-40k-aos-sisters-of-battle,2024-05-21 17:19:16
"Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree trailer is part lore dump, part war recruitment ad ","FromSoftware released a new trailer for Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree on Tuesday, giving fans of the open-world fantasy adventure a fresh look at the DLCâs story. That includes new details on its imposing new villain, Messmer the Impaler, a powerful demigod who appears to have a strong connection to characters from the original Elden Ring story.
Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtreeâs new trailer also hints at what sent the demigod Miquella to a new land, one that was crushed under the tyranny of Messmerâs flame, and for which Miquella sacrificed himself. The trailer ends with the followers of Miquella joining forces and beckoning new warriors to join them on their journey to depose Messmer and his burning legions.
Our latest look at Shadow of the Erdtree is something weâve come to expect from FromSoft: a CG trailer that dives deeper into the opaque lore of Elden Ring and doesnât offer anything in the way of new gameplay. But for students of Elden Ring myth, itâs a rich vein of information about characters and their allegiances in this complicated family story.
Shadow of the Erdtree will send players to an unexplored region known as the Land of Shadow, just a short egg ride from Mohgwyn Palace. There, in a landmass roughly the size of the gameâs Limgrave region, theyâll explore the dark realm and follow in the footsteps of the mysterious Empyrean Miquella.
Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree will be released on June 21. The expansion is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via Steam, just like the original Elden Ring.

So when is Call of Duty coming to Game Pass?,"Last October, Microsoft completed its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and took ownership of a raft of huge gaming properties, not least among them Activisionâs Call of Duty series. Microsoft is now theoretically free to add all Activision Blizzard games to its Game Pass subscription service on Xbox and PC. So itâs natural to wonder when Call of Duty games â 2024âs installment in particular â will hit Game Pass.
In a teaser trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, now confirmed as 2024âs Call of Duty game, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have confirmed that the game will arrive to Game Pass on day one. Black Ops 6 doesnât have a release date yet, but based on previous titles can be expected in late October or early November 2024. Microsoft will unveil the game and detail its release plans at the Xbox showcase on June 9.
Activision Blizzard, moving to get ahead of speculation before the completion of the deal with Microsoft, said on Oct. 9, 2023 that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and its other big 2023 release, Diablo 4, wouldnât be added to Game Pass that year, but said it did plan plan to begin adding games to Game Pass in 2024. Indeed, Diablo 4 was added to Game Pass back in March.
Speaking to the official Xbox podcast on Oct. 17, 2023, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said, âThe regulatory process took so long [...] that we werenât able to get in and work with Activision Blizzard on that back catalog work. Now that the deal is closed, weâre starting that work, but there is work.â Spencer continued: âThe fact that weâre not hitting day one with a bunch of games dropping in to Game Pass is a little bit of a downer, but Iâm very excited about the future.â
This is unclear. Microsoft could have added older Call of Duty titles to Game Pass by now, and many expected it to, but it hasnât. Microsoft began adding Bethesda games to Game Pass within weeks of that deal being completed in March 2021. The initial list ran to 20 games, focused on back catalog titles. But this hasnât happened for Activision Blizzard games.
As for the most recent game in the series, Modern Warfare 3, Activision has a marketing deal with Sony that will probably preclude that gameâs arrival on Game Pass for anything from six months to a year. It also has a well established marketing and business plan for Call of Duty that works on an annual schedule, which Microsoft may not want to ride roughshod over. For those reasons, we wouldnât expect to see Modern Warfare 3 on Game Pass until the end of 2024 â at which point it would be overshadowed by Black Ops 6, anyway.
Perhaps Microsoft wants to make the biggest splash possible by having the first Call of Duty title to hit Game Pass be 2024âs brand-new installment. Microsoft may choose to put a range of Call of Duty games on the service at the same time â or it might just focus on the big new release.
A clue to Microsoftâs strategy is its handling of Diablo games on Game Pass. Once again, many expected older games like Diablo 3 and Diablo 2 Resurrected to appear on Game Pass quite soon after the acquisition, but this didnât happen. Instead, the latest release, Diablo 4, arrived with a splash in March 2024. It seems Microsoft is less focused on putting the whole Blizzard back catalog on Game Pass than it was with Bethesda.
One of the biggest unknowns is World of Warcraft. The massively multiplayer game will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2024, but still enjoys a healthy audience which pays WoWâs own monthly subscription fee to play it. Will Microsoft be willing to cannibalize this revenue stream for the sake of what would be a unique and substantial value-add to Game Pass? Perhaps it will, but itâs a difficult calculation to make â so we wouldnât expect to see it in the first wave of games added, if at all.
As for Overwatch 2, itâs a free-to-play game, so this is less relevant. But Game Pass subscribers have already received some perks for the title, including immediate unlocks for some of the gameâs heroes.

Update (Oct. 18, 2023): This article has been updated with comments from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer.

Nintendo acquiring the studio that ported Hogwarts Legacy is super interesting,"In a move that has surprised literally everyone, Nintendo has made a studio acquisition. In a rare move, the company bought Shiver Entertainment, a Miami-based port specialist, from embattled Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group.
Shiver, notably, is the studio that somehow managed to bring both Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy to Nintendo Switch in 2023. Given the enormous gulf in power between the Switch and the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, this was no easy task, and the results left quite a lot to be desired. But merely getting feature-complete and functional versions of these games up and running on Switch could be considered an achievement in itself.
At any rate, Shiverâs work seems to have impressed Nintendo enough that it took the unusual step (for Nintendo) of dipping into its vast cash reserves and actually buying something. (Nintendo is actually the richest company in Japan, going by money in the bank, perhaps precisely because it never spends on itself. Historically, the company has been quite uninterested in late capitalismâs obsession with growth above all else, preferring good, old-fashioned profit â and Scrooge McDuck-style piles of money.)
Nintendoâs press release makes it clear that Shiverâs port expertise is why it bought the studio. It specifically shouts out Shiverâs work on Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy, notes the studioâs âhigh-level resources for porting and developing software titles,â and says that after acquisition âShiverâs focus will remain the same, continuing commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch.â
But why would Nintendo be interested in acquiring a third-party, work-for-hire port specialist in the first place? There are many studios that specialize in this sort of thing, but theyâre rarely acquired by platform-holders like Nintendo. When this does happen, itâs more likely to be a studio that makes shiny, enhanced remasters of older games â like Bluepoint Games, which was acquired by Sony in 2021 â than an outfit that specializes in the less glamorous work of wrestling the latest releases onto less powerful hardware.
The most obvious conclusion is that, when it comes to the Switch 2, Nintendo is getting serious about reducing the gap in software libraries between its hybrid handheld and the current generation of home consoles and PCs. It wants AAA games to launch on its next console, and to that end, it has taken the unprecedented step of bringing porting expertise in-house, so it can offer this service to third-party publishers itself. It will probably find a willing market; Square Enix, for one, has recently indicated that it wants to bring its biggest games to as many platforms as it can, including Nintendoâs.
Shiver is particularly experienced with Unreal Engine titles, and Nintendo has reportedly been demonstrating the Switch 2âs ability to run Unreal Engine 5 to its partners. And while the Switch 2 will certainly be less powerful than PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, reports indicate that it will be able to get quite close to them in terms of its visuals, in part thanks to use of Nvidiaâs AI-powered DLSS upscaling technology.
Thereâs one last question. Why does Nintendo mention that, âeven after it becomes part of the Nintendo group,â Shiver will continue to work porting games to âmultiple platformsâ? This is most likely a veiled reference to the Switch 2 â which Nintendo has not named, though recently admitted exists. But it may also be that Nintendo is happy to let Shiver continue to work on other systems, partly so it can learn more about them and expand its porting expertise.
Either way, itâs a fascinating development, and an indication that Nintendo is getting ready to step a little further out of its bubble with the Switch 2, and reintegrate with the rest of the game industry.

Ben Schwartz and other comedy greats join Make Some Noise season 3,"Dropout TVâs lightly competitive improv prompt show Make Some Noise returns next month with a third season â and what a star studded season it is. 
Make Some Noise is no stranger to guest stars from outside the core Dropout cast, but the showâs second season raised the ante with improv royalty Wayne Brady of Whoâs Line Is It Anyway? And in a newly released trailer for season 3, Dropout teases Pete Holmes of Crashing, Rachel Bloom of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, and Ben Schwartz of âThe fastest interview ever with Ben Schwartz from Sonic the Hedgehog.â 
Naturally, Dropoutâs core cast of comedy talent will also feature, including a now traditional reunion of the âNoise Boys,â Josh Ruben, Zac Oyama and Brennan Lee Mulligan, who originated the format at Dropout; new iterations on fan favorite prompts and minigames; and at least one more musical improv episode. 
Make Some Noise season 3 will premiere a 20 episode season on June 24, and air biweekly on Mondays on Dropout. ",https://www.polygon.com/24160862/dropout-make-some-noise-season-3-ben-schwartz,2024-05-20 17:30:00
The Matrix and Friday the 13th villains join the MultiVersus roster,"The MultiVersus roster is expanding again, this time with two big bad guys: Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th horror franchise and Agent Smith from the Matrix films. Those two villains will join a pair of recently confirmed additions to MultiVersus: the Joker and Adventure Timeâs Banana Guard. 
Developer Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games confirmed Jason and Agent Smith in a new cinematic trailer hyping up the impending relaunch of MultiVersus. And if you comb through Mondayâs new MultiVersus trailer, you might spot teases for a few more unannounced characters. At one point (about 50 seconds in), we see Bugs Bunny crack open the Warner Bros. water tower, from which a few props escape. Those items appear to be Aquamanâs trident, Samurai Jackâs katana, and Octi, the beloved plush octopus of Bubbles from The Powerpuff Girls. Thereâs also a broomstick, which could belong to the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz or someone from the Harry Potter franchise.
There are also background references to DC superheroes Green Lantern, Robin in his Teen Titans Go! form, and Raven, though itâs unclear if those are teases or simply stage dressing.
Player First and WB seem to be leaning toward bad guys for the debut season of MultiVersusâ relaunch, season 1 of which is titled Puns & Villainy. So if youâre guessing at new additions in the coming weeks and months, think supervillains.
MultiVersus comes back on May 28, with new additions Joker, Jason Voorhees, and Banana Guard available at launch, and Agent Smith coming sometime later in season 1. Theyâll join existing characters featured in the trailer: Wonder Woman; Velma; Bugs Bunny; Marvin the Martian; Iron Giant; Rick Sanchez (who apparently knows Batmanâs secret identity); Stripe from Gremlins; Finn the Human; and Cake the Cat, a variant of Adventure Timeâs Jake the Dog.
WBâs free-to-play fighting game will be available again for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X next week. It will boast a major new feature called Rifts, MultiVersusâ take on a PvE mode.",https://www.polygon.com/24160800/multiversus-trailer-matrix-agent-smith-jason-voorhees,2024-05-20 15:42:32
Twitch unbans shaking butts and twerking for animated emotes,"Finally, all those little dumpy Crewmates from Among Us can start shaking their asses on Twitch again. CEO Dan Clancy announced changes to the platformâs Community Guidelines  on Wednesday, allowing cute animated emotes where characters shake their butts and twerk will be allowed on the platform. 
Emotes help cultivate lively and active viewers in Twitch. Oftentimes, spamming emotes and using channel-specific icons in the chat can be just as fun as consuming the content itself. Now, the team is changing the emote content rules so that theyâre in line with the general Community Guidelines. This means: time to twerk. 
âSo in particular emotes that feature shaking butts â commonly referred to as twerking but weâll just call them shaking butts â are now permitted under our guidelines,â Clancy said on Patch Notes livestream on Wednesday. 
The banned emotes were never particularly graphic to begin with and impacted a lot of simple cartoon drawings. Twitch users reported strict moderation in response to the emotes in the summer on 2021. But now, those restrictions wonât apply. Polygon reached out to Twitch to ask about the change and a representative of the company replied with the following statement: 
We set out to clarify how emotes are evaluated for approval by our teams. Before today, the guidelines we used to evaluate emote requests differed from our Community Guidelines, in some ways. We realize that this may have caused confusion, as it wasnât always clear how we made approval decisions. Now, weâve brought our emote guidelines more in line with the rest of our Community Guidelines. We think this step will help to clarify our decision-making process for the community, something thatâs important to us.
Twitch users have already embraced the change with open cheeks. Popular memes â like a GIF where a Crewmate from Among Us shakes and bounces its butt â will be able to make a return to Twitch chat. The ass-shaking has long been a popular format for emotes in general so artists have been responding by sharing art of various characters and other cute little drawings of characters shaking their butts. So if youâre a fan of cheeky art like of this voluptuous Kirby, well ,youâre in luck, because now you might see plenty of it on Twitch.

"Talisman, one of the OG dungeon crawlers, is back with a 5th edition this summer","First published by Games Workshop in 1983, Talisman: The Magical Quest Game is remembered fondly by kids who grew up with board games in the 1980s and early 1990s. But the last version of the dungeon crawling board game, its fourth, was published way back in 2008, well before the modern board gaming Renaissance really began. Now Hasbro is bringing it back for a fifth edition. Pre-orders, priced at $59.99, are live now. The game returns to mass market retail on July 1.
In Talisman, players take on the role of stock fantasy heroes on the quest for a MacGuffin called the Crown of Command. The highly linear board game takes players round and round a citadel, where they encounter traps and monsters, and even fight against the other players at the table. Itâs an unusual hybrid of an action-oriented tabletop role-playing game and something like Candyland, but a novel format that has resonated with generations of casual fans of tabletop games.
Polygon reached out to Hasbro following Fridayâs press release. They confirmed that the IP hasnât changed hands. Instead, the game is being produced under license from Games Workshop. Hereâs the official description:
In the game, players set forth on an epic adventure, racing to be the first to obtain a Talisman, reach the Crown of Command in the center of the board, and defeat the elder dragon to win. With a diverse range of characters to choose from and a vast world of possible scenarios plus an easy to use, revised 5th Edition Rulebook, this strategy game offers limitless adventures!
While the game retains the traditional spiral game board, new cover art was revealed showing a crumbling staircase leading to a glowing crown while giant statues of gilded heroes look on. Product photos also show plastic 12 plastic miniatures for each of the 12 included character classes. More information is promised in the weeks ahead. For now, all we have is the gallery of images below.

Fallout is coming to Fortnite,"Fallout is coming to Fortnite. Exactly how and when Bethesda Softworksâ post-apocalyptic franchise is coming to Epicâs battle royale-turned-everything game is unclear, but weâre pretty much guaranteed to get some cartoonish power armor out of it. Weâre also likely to get some Vault Dweller jumpsuits, but it remains to be seen what exactly Epic and Bethesda have cooked up for the highly anticipated collaboration.
The official Fortnite social media account on X (formerly Twitter) teased the crossover on Friday, hinting that Fallout-style bases and post-nuclear devastation could be dropping in on the battle royale island. No doubt Vault Boy will also make an appearance as part of the collab.
 pic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST
Interest in the Fallout franchise is at a high point right now, thanks to Amazonâs Fallout TV series and the recent ânext-genâ update for Fallout 4. That free upgrade rolled out for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of Fallout 4 in April, and Bethesdaâs been patching it up since.
Fortnite players may get their hands on that Fallout-inspired content as early as next week. Chapter 5 season 3 of Fortnite â reportedly titled âWreckedâ â is expected to launch on May 24.
The Fallout franchise appears to also be coming to another big game soon: Call of Duty. Dataminers have uncovered references to Fallout (alongside Gundam and The Crow) that could be hints about content planned for season 4 of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone 2.0. Call of Dutyâs next season launches May 29.

The Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Switch game calls back one of Nintendoâs coolest events,"You might not know this if you grew up in the later eras of Nintendo, but the company ran an esports competition called the Nintendo World Championships way back in 1990. The event toured 29 American cities and players from across the country gathered to compete using a custom Nintendo Entertainment System Game Pak. The cartridge used in the event went on to become a prized collectorsâ item, but now, players will get a chance to buy a physical item directly inspired by it. 
On Wednesday, Nintendo shared a trailer for the upcoming game, Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition. The game recreates the competitive spirit of the event and will allow players to speedrun more than 150 âchallenging momentsâ from across 13 NES games like Super Mario Bros. and Metroid. In addition to the virtual eShop download, the company announced Nintendo World Championships would be getting a physical edition as well. And while itâs not replacement for those rare early NES cartridges from the actual competition â the physical version of the game has plenty to ooh and aah over. 
You can buy the Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition â Deluxe Set off of Nintendoâs website. It will go on sale July 18 and cost $59.99. (The virtual game-only version costs $29.99.) The Deluxe Set comes with a Gold replica NES cartridge and stand to commemorate the 1990 World Championships, the Nintendo Switch game card, 13 art cards, and a set of five pins. The golden NES pack cartridge is not playable, but this physical version touts details like embossed pixel art of the Nintendo games featured in the World Championships event. 
The set is so pretty that prospective buyers are already expressing concern about scalpers in the comment section under the trailer on YouTube. So if you want to buy a unique physical edition then make sure you watch Nintendoâs site on July 18.

Hereâs your first look at EA Sports College Football 25 gameplay,"With the release of EA Sports College Football 25 just two months away, weâve now got our first glimpse of what the game looks like in action, courtesy of a proper trailer that publisher Electronic Arts released Friday morning.
Transitioning from Guns Nâ Rosesâ original recording of âWelcome to the Jungleâ â a quintessential hype-up-the-fans song â into a marching band version is a very nice touch in this trailer. And it plays over footage of storied college football traditions from all over the country: unique team entrances (with, for the first time, real names on the backs of jerseys), mascots getting everyone into a frenzy, and crowds singing fight songs. Itâs clear that developer EA Tiburon has gone to great lengths to bring the game-day atmosphere of college football to life in College Football 25.
EA also revealed the first details about College Football 25âs modes and gameplay, confirming the return of the fan-favorite franchise and career modes â Dynasty and Road to Glory, respectively â as well as a new competitive online offering called Road to the College Football Playoff. In that mode, players can choose a school and work toward winning a national championship by progressing through divisions and earning rank. In a way, its existence can be seen as a nod to the 11-year gap between EAâs college football games: The College Football Playoff wasnât a thing when EA released NCAA Football 14 back in 2013. And, yes, EAâs microtransaction-based fantasy team setup, Ultimate Team, figures to be a major part of the game, especially now that EA can use playersâ real names.
Online play in College Football 25 will support cross-platform play, according to an FAQ on  the gameâs website. People on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will be able to play each other in the Road to the College Football Playoff and College Football Ultimate Team modes, as well as in head-to-head matches with friends.
In addition, EA Tiburon is bringing back Team Builder, the web-based feature that allowed players to set up their own college football program by designing a schoolâs logos, uniforms, helmets, and stadiums. After creating a football program, players will be able to import it into their game for use in the Dynasty mode and offline exhibition games. The Team Builder app will also allow players to browse other peopleâs uploaded creations.
College football doesnât look the same on the field as the NFL, and EA Tiburon is touting some new (and returning) gameplay features this year to differentiate the action not just in general, but on a team-by-team basis. One is a gamified version of home-field advantage: If youâre taking Ohio State into the Big House for a showdown with the Wolverines, expect âdistractions like screen shaking, missing pre-play icons, and moving play art,â according to EA. The developers are also introducing a wear-and-tear system that will force you to manage fatigue and make the right substitutions at the right times to prevent players from becoming tired (and making mistakes).
Off the field, EA is bringing back a bunch of veterans from ESPNâs college football broadcasts for audio commentary in College Football 25. Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit will call âmarquee matchups,â said EA, while Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, and David Pollack will handle all other games.
EA Sports College Football 25 will be released July 19 on PS5 and Xbox Series X. While EA is also pairing it with Madden NFL 25 (which is scheduled for an Aug. 16 debut) in a package called the MVP Bundle, thereâs no word yet on whether there will be any cross-game functionality between the two.
Update: Weâve added more details about College Football 25âs modes and features, along with a few new screenshots, to this story.",https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes,2024-05-17 15:31:43
Early look at Valveâs new hero shooter Deadlock leaks,"A new multiplayer hero shooter reportedly in development at Valve leaked Thursday in the form of gameplay details and early screenshots of the project, known as Deadlock. The new game is described as a blend of Valveâs own Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2, as well as competing multiplayer games like Overwatch, Valorant, Smite, and Orcs Must Die.
Valve-focused content creator known as Gabe Follower published the in-game screenshots on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. The account said the images were shared by Deadlock playtesters, and show Dota 2-style heroes battling on âsteampunk European cityâ maps. One of those maps has fast-travel lanes; players can ride quickly across the maps using âfloating rails, similar to BioShock Infinite.â
Gabe Follower said that Deadlock is Valveâs next game, and that it was in development under previous names Neon Prime and Citadel. He describes it as a competitive, third-person, hero-based shooter, with two teams of six heroes â a mix of âmagicians, weird creatures, and robotsâ â battling each other. Deadlock also reportedly features tower defense game mechanics.
Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz
Screenshots of Deadlock hint at MOBA-inspired elements like bases and guardians that heroes would attack, and collectible orbs that may offer power-ups to abilities. All of that is, of course, subject to change, as Deadlock has not been officially announced.
Deadlock was reportedly styled as a sci-fi game âinspired by Half-Life and Portal,â but feedback to the gameâs aesthetic pushed Valve to âfocus on fantasy.â Valve has reportedly been working on Deadlock since 2018.
Details on Deadlock were corroborated by longtime Valve reporter Tyler McVicker, who previously published under the Valve News Network moniker. In a video published on Thursday about the in-development game, McVicker said that Deadlock is currently being played in a closed alpha form by an unknown number of people outside of Valve. McVicker described Deadlock as âvery personality drivenâ and Valveâs ânext major competitive game.â
Polygon has reached out to Valve to confirm details on Deadlock and will update when the company responds.

Valve boss and co-founder Gabe Newell said in 2021 that his company has multiple games in development. Last September, Valve shipped one of those games, Counter-Strike 2, a replacement for its extremely popular first-person shooter, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, originally released in 2012. Newell also intimated in 2021 that there was âa lot of momentum inside of the companyâ to develop more single-player games in the wake of shipping Half-Life: Alyx in 2020.
For now, though, it appears that Valveâs interests lie in multiplayer and blending the gameplay of its most popular team-based games.
Correction: A previous version of this story named Tyler McVicker as the person responsible for publishing screenshots of Deadlock. Those details and images were published to social media by an account named Gabe Follower, not McVicker.",https://www.polygon.com/24158960/valve-deadlock-hero-shooter-leak,2024-05-17 15:20:00
"Endless Legend, a great 2014 strategy game, is free on Steam for one week","Itâs time to do a bit of casual Friday colonizing (virtually). Amplitude Studios, the Parisian game studio known for strategy games, is giving away its acclaimed game Endless Legend for free on Steam. Starting on Thursday and running until May 23, interested players can download the entire game for free on Steam. 
The deal is an absolute steal. Usually, the game costs  $29.99 at full price. Now all you have to do is go to the Steam page to get it for free. Just proceed as if you were buying any other game on the platform. The Steam version is available to play on Windows PC and Mac OS. 
Endless Legend is a top-down 4X game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) in which players defeat opponents by harvesting resources and building military units and additional support buildings. The game is complicated and a bit imbalanced â and intentionally so. The developers created the game so that each play-through would have variation. Each raceâs basic unit has several stats and special powers that makes them unique, so that players wouldnât face units with identical stats to their own. 
Amplitude Studios originally published the game to Steam in 2014. At the time, Endless Legend helped bring a new layer of complexity to the turn-based strategy genre. So if you want to have a try at long-beloved strategy game, now is your chance.",https://www.polygon.com/24158948/endless-legend-strategy-game-free-steam,2024-05-17 15:10:00
"This yearâs Call of Duty will go straight to Game Pass, report says","Microsoft intends to put its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard to use by releasing the next Call of Duty game directly on its Game Pass subscription service, the Wall Street Journal reports. The WSJ says the plan will be announced at Xboxâs annual summer showcase on June 9.
The move has been expected ever since Microsoft first announced its intention to buy the publisher. Call of Duty is Activisionâs biggest franchise, and its potential value to Game Pass was assumed to be the crown jewel of the acquisition â particularly after Microsoft made it clear that it would not consider making Call of Duty games console-exclusive to Xbox.
But there were still persistent doubts that Microsoft would pull the trigger and make Call of Duty a day-one Game Pass release. The series, which sees a new full-price release every calendar year, is enormously lucrative, selling around 25 million copies annually. The financial wisdom of allowing those sales to be cannibalized as a loss-leader to grow subscription numbers has been questioned.
There have been some signs that Microsoft was cooling on Game Pass as a business model, too. The company only recently ended a two-year silence on subscriber numbers (they stand at 34 million, apparently), and Microsoft gaming chief Phil Spencer has admitted to a slowdown in growth. A recent move toward multiplatform publishing indicated that Microsoft is more focused on maximizing profit by selling games wherever possible than in investing in its platforms. And some interpreted the closure of the studios Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin as a sign that Microsoft was more interested in making games with strong sales potential than in stocking Game Pass with a broad range of titles, which had seemed to be its goal during its long studio acquisition spree.
In that context, sacrificing sales by putting the latest Call of Duty on Game Pass is a clear sign that Microsoft is committed to the service â and that Plan A is still very much in effect.",https://www.polygon.com/24158941/call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-microsoft,2024-05-17 14:38:59
"MultiVersusâ new PvE mode, explained","When MultiVersus relaunches with a makeover later this month after a nearly yearlong hiatus, it will come equipped with a new PvE mode called Rifts that will let players take on tutorials, challenges, and story-based missions. In a new video breaking down Rifts, we see what kind if minigames and giant boss fights â and some other oddities â players can expect.
Rifts, Scooby-Dooâs Velma explains, are composed of chapters, which are divided into nodes that give players various battles and challenges. Each node has its own mutators to keep things interesting (and occasionally very weird, based on the above footage), and players can earn rewards by completing those nodes.
Warner Bros. and developer Player First Games pitch Rifts as a way for players to âlearn mechanics, test characters, and sharpen skillsâ without having to wade into the dangerous waters of MultiVersusâ online competitive play. And it sounds like Rifts will continue to evolve and be added to over time.
MultiVersus will relaunch on May 28 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. Player First says it has rebuilt the game from the ground up to support new netcode and upgraded visuals. There will also be new characters; in addition to the recently announced Joker, MultiVersusâ new video teases two more still-unannounced additions to the roster â one of those slots could be beloved cartoon trio The Powerpuff Girls.",https://www.polygon.com/24158526/multiversus-pve-mode-rifts-video,2024-05-16 21:32:00
"ShÅgunâs coming back for season 2, but no oneâs quite sure how just yet","ShÅgun is an early contender for 2024âs best TV show. The series, which debuted in February, is smart, complicated, tremendously well made, beautifully acted, and the most watched FX series ever, according to a press release from the network. All of which makes Thursdayâs announcement that the show is coming back for more season pretty unsurprising. The only question that remains is what exactly those seasons are going to be about. 
According to FXâs announcement, the series is coming back for two additional seasons. Development on the new seasons will begin soon, with work taking place between FX and the estate of original ShÅgun author, James Clavell. The upcoming seasons will also bring back many of the key talents behind season 1, including co-creators, showrunners, executive producers, and writers, Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo, as well as executive producer Michaela Clavell, and producer and series star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Lord Yoshii Toranaga in season 1.
ShÅgunâs first season is an adaptation of James Clavellâs novel of the same name, which was originally released in 1975. The showâs first season adapts Clavellâs entire (very long) novel, which leaves the question of what exactly it will cover in its next two seasons up for debate. 
One possible option for the show could be looking to Clavellâs other work for inspiration. While ShÅgun is unquestionably the most popular of the books, Clavell actually wrote three more novels in his Asian Saga, with ShÅgun being the first chronologically. He also wrote Tai-Pan, a book about two traders venturing into Hong Kong in the 1840s after the First Opium War, Gai-Jin, a sequel to Tai-Pan set 20 years later and mostly in Japan, and Noble House, which is set back in Hong Kong in 1963. 
This variety of novels could provide a solid basis for several seasons, each taking place in a distinct time and place. However, this would bring with it plenty of other problems including issues of cultural accuracy. Both Marks and Kondo have been very vocal about the accuracy of ShÅgun being extremely important to them, frequently rewriting scenes to better reflect cultural Japanese attitudes of the time. To suddenly transplant the series to an entirely new country, with an entirely new culture and different customs would be a massive undertaking, and surely change the show significantly. Although thatâs not to say it couldnât be done. 
Perhaps even more compelling though is the presence of Sanada. With the legendary Japanese actor returning to the show, and his towering performance as Toranaga being a standout aspect of the seriesâ first season, it seems more likely that Marks, Kondo, and the rest of the production would opt to keep the story in Japan and create a series thatâs a more direct follow up to ShÅgunâs story. Thankfully, this period of Japanese history has no shortage of fascinating and complex topics for the show to cover. 
While Clavellâs original novel changes the names of famous Japanese historical figures, it is closely based on the countryâs real history, which means we too can look to history to see what could be next for the show. Toranaga is based on Tokugawa Ieyasu, a real Japanese daimyo and the first shÅgun of the mighty Tokugawa shogunate which ruled the country from 1603 until 1868.
The first season ends with Toranaga on the verge of capturing Osaka Castle, a real thing Ieyasu did (although slightly earlier than 1600). So, if the timeline of Japanese history is what the show plans to follow, then the next season would likely be about the fallout of Toranagaâs decision to openly grab power. In real life, Ieyasu met with quite a bit of resistance in the form of a rival daimyo named Ishida Mitsunari who would go on to lead an army in opposition to Ieyasu, throwing Japan into a civil war. 
Weâll stop the story there at the risk of revealing several potentially significant plot points, but needless to say a civil war would give future seasons of ShÅgun plenty of ground for great television. 
Of course, we wonât know for sure what exactly these upcoming seasons of ShÅgun will be based on until FX makes an official announcement, but we know weâll be watching no matter what.

Grand Theft Auto 6 now expected out in fall 2025,"Grand Theft Auto 6 will be released in the fall of 2025, according to publisher Take-Two Interactive. The release window â however vague â is a narrowing of what Take-Two Interactive had previously shared when it put Grand Theft Auto 6 simply within the 2025 calendar year. The fall 2025 release window makes sense, placing the much-anticipated game right before the holidays.
âWe are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase,â Take-Two Interactive said in its most recent earnings report. âLooking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027.â
Of course, thereâs always the chance for a delay. Rockstar Games is infamous for delaying its games to ensure a serious level of polish; Red Dead Redemption 2 was publicly delayed three times, while Grand Theft Auto 5 had a major delay in 2013. Take-Two Interactiveâs willingness to publicly narrow the release window as part of its fiscal report could signal confidence in Rockstarâs ability to meet that date.
Grand Theft Auto 6 was officially revealed on Dec. 4, a day earlier than expected after its reveal trailer leaked online. The game is set in Vice City, Grand Theft Autoâs Miami â a location the game centered on with 2002âs Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and 2006 prequel Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories. Those games were set in the 1980s, but Rockstar Games has set Grand Theft Auto 6 in the modern day, centering on a Bonnie and Clyde-esque duo in Jason and Lucia, the latter of which is the seriesâ first playable female protagonist.
Grand Theft Auto 5 is still a hit, too, with Take-Two Interactive reporting 5 million copies sold within its last financial quarter, totaling 200 million games sold since its release.
Take-Two Interactive also reported it expects to reach $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion in net bookings in fiscal year 2025. Ahead of the filing, in April, Take-Two Interactive laid off 5% of its staff, or about 600 workers. (Despite the layoffs, Take-Two Interactive said it has expanded its staff.) It also canceled several projects â none of which were âcore franchisesâ â but it still has 40 games in its pipeline throughout fiscal year 2027, Take-Two Interactive president Karl Slatoff said during the earnings conference call.",https://www.polygon.com/24158506/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-date-fall-2025,2024-05-16 20:53:38
"Halle Berryâs new survival horror movie, Never Let Go, looks like a terrifying trip to the woods","The low-key king of the modern survival-horror movie, Alexandre Aja â whoâs made movies like Crawl, Oxygen, and The Hills Have Eyes â is back with a new film staring Halle Berry. The first trailer for Never Let Go was released on Thursday, and the movie already looks like a terrifying addition to Ajaâs impressive canon of people trying to survive the very bad things that are happening to them. 
Never Let Go stars Berry as a mother of two twin boys. The whole family lives in the woods, way off the grid, with Berry insisting that they have to stay safe from the evil spirits that surround their cabin. One day, however, one of the boys starts to wonder if these spirits are real and sets out to discover the truth, only to get stranded in the woods, with his mother desperately trying to save him. 
The trailer feels like a mix of M. Night Shyamalanâs The Village and John Krasinskiâs A Quiet Place, with all the tension that combination implies. Berryâs character leads her kids into the woods, a rope tying them all together so no one gets lost, making for a pretty haunting image, and thatâs not including the strange hands that reach out to grab the characters every now and then. 
Along with Berry, the movie will also star Anthony B. Jenkins and Percy Daggs IV as her two sons, as well as Matthew Kevin Anderson as âThe Strangerâ and Stephanie Lavigne, whose character is simply called âThe Evil.â 
Never Let Go is set to be released in theaters on Sept. 27.",https://www.polygon.com/24158450/never-let-go-trailer-release-date-halle-berry-crawl-director,2024-05-16 20:05:11
You can now play Minecraft in Google â kind of,"Minecraft is turning 15 years old. Somehow, it feels like itâs been around for much, much longer, which speaks to the ubiquity of the game. Despite its age, Minecraft is still wildly popular due its its sandbox-style gameplay â you can do or make almost anything. You can already play it on your computer, console, or mobile phone, but Microsoftâs added one more platform: Google search.
To celebrate the gameâs 15th anniversary, Minecraft is playable in Google Search â sort of. Head over to Google and search for Minecraft. Youâll see a little grass block at the bottom of the screen. Hit that, and itâll turn into a pickaxe. Then just click away. All over the screen, youâll uncover a bunch of different Minecraft vignettes. Keep on tapping to bludgeon your way through all sorts of Minecraft bricks and experience the satisfying crunch of breaking stuff.
Since I found it, Iâve been breaking my way through wood, dirt, snow, stone, and even clouds. Thereâs not much â or anything â else you can do in there, as far as Iâve experienced, but it has proved amusing enough for me! Iâll be over here clicking away until I understand how Jack Black is playing Steve in the upcoming Minecraft movie.",https://www.polygon.com/24158379/minecraft-google-doodle-anniversary-easter-egg,2024-05-16 19:13:23
Iâm going to watch the MoviePass documentary for one reason only,"Max has released a trailer for its documentary MoviePass, MovieCrash, coming to the streaming service on May 29. And frankly, it looks awful. The trailer makes the film look like the worst kind of bubbly, hyperbolic TV news report, full of over-the-top voiceover, staccato sound bites, and sensationalist quotes, all trying to inject riffy, bouncy energy into a story that doesnât need zhuzhing up. The actual doc may be nothing like this; trailers are notoriously unreliable about reflecting what a movie is actually like. But either way, I donât care. Iâm all in, for one reason: I just want to see the faces of the people behind the story I followed with absolute nonstop disbelief for two full years of âOh God, what now?â schadenfreude.
MoviePass was around for six years as a largely under-the-radar, somewhat pricey subscription service for movie tickets before analytics firm Helios and Matheson acquired it. In 2017, the revamped company introduced an unbeatable subscription service: Members could get unlimited movie tickets for about $10 a month. âHow could this business model possibly work?â industry-watchers asked at the time. The answer: It couldnât. Helios and Matheson lost hundreds of millions of dollars on the project, while visibly, awkwardly, and very publicly flailing to redefine the companyâs intentions every few weeks.
While all this was happening, I was the Movies Editor over at The Verge, and we reported on every new beat in the story as it happened, because our readers loved knowing what new nonsense MoviePass was up to. What made the story so fascinating and engaging was how absolutely clear it was that Helios and Matheson did not know anything about the industry it was trying to disrupt, and how rapidly it kept changing the story about what MoviePass was intended to do.
The company clearly thought its subscriber base would give it leverage over the industry, and was willing to endure huge losses while it tried to figure out what to do with that leverage. One week, it was effectively trying to blackmail theater chains into giving it discounts, or risk MoviePass diverting its subscribers to different chains. Similarly, it tried to extort studios into paying it for advertising, or risk the service blocking subscribers from buying tickets to those studiosâ latest movies.
At one point, the company boasted about the tracking data it was collecting on its subscribers with the intention of selling that data to investors; after a backlash, it abruptly walked that idea back. Then MoviePass suddenly announced it would become a film distributor. Meanwhile, it changed its pricing and the services it offered too many times to count, often with no notice for subscribers, who would suddenly find themselves opted into new plans, even if theyâd already left the service. At its lowest point, the company sent out a cutesy email claiming it had hired a dog as its new marketing director, and apologizing for the âruffâ time subscribers were having with the service. The companyâs shareholders sued. The subscribers did, too.
I donât need to watch MoviePass, MovieCrash for a summary of all this â I lived it, and not that long ago. What I want is to see the people behind the debacle. Throughout the two-year barrage of frantic, nonstop news about MoviePassâ endless abrupt retoolings, the public face on every new debacle was CEO Mitch Lowe. But there were obviously so many more people battling for control behind the scenes, desperately trying to land on the solution that would turn the ship around. All I want from a MoviePass documentary is to know what it was like for everyone who wasnât Lowe, who wasnât in front of the cameras trying to justify how Helios and Matheson was hemorrhaging money, being investigated for fraud, and watching its stock plummet 99 percent. I just want to put faces to this wild, freewheeling disaster, at long last.
Hereâs the official rundown on the film, from Warner Bros. Discovery and HBO Original:
The HBO Original documentary MOVIEPASS, MOVIECRASH, directed by award-winning filmmaker MutaâAli (HBOâs âYusuf Hawkins: Storm Over Brooklynâ), debuts WEDNESDAY, MAY 29 at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT on HBO and will be available to stream on Max. In a span of eight years, MoviePass went from being the fastest growing subscription service since Spotify to total bankruptcy, losing over $150 million in 2017 alone. MOVIEPASS, MOVIECRASH chronicles the companyâs beginnings as an innovative movie ticketing model beloved by cinema goers, exploring the visionary mission of its entrepreneur co-founders, its impressive early successes, and its precipitous downfall caused by mismanagement and corporate greed.

We wrote a huge book about Lord of the Rings!,"We are thrilled to announce Polygonâs latest book: Year of the Ring, an in-depth exploration of Peter Jacksonâs Lord of the Rings trilogy and the books that inspired them. Year of the Ring â authored by Susana Polo and a variety of Polygon contributors â will hit stores on Oct. 15, 2024, kicking off Polygon Pages, an ongoing publishing partnership with Insight Editions.
Hereâs how our publisher describes the book: 
Year of the Ring is a beautiful hardcover volume that chronicles the origins and incarnations of J.R.R. Tolkienâs foundational text as it has wended its way towards leaving an indelible stamp on pop culture. The book charts the history of Lord of the Rings from Tolkienâs original books up through Peter Jacksonâs landmark trilogy of adaptations and the lasting cultural impact theyâve all left on mass culture. Year of the Ring is an absolute treasure trove for fans of the series and those of us out there whoâve found Tolkienâs fantastically imaginative world difficult to leave.
The book pulls from Polygonâs yearlong Year of the Ring editorial package, in which Polo partnered with writers, authors, and fans to revisit the iconic films in new ways. Molly Ostertag wrote about queer readings of the series. The âotherâ actor who played Gimli told his tale of life on set. We even uncovered Peter Jacksonâs original two-movie pitch for the series.
In the coming months, weâll have news on additional books in the Polygon Pages series. Weâre so excited to continue our history of producing awesome, beautiful, and informative books about the stuff we love! Be sure to pre-order Year of the Ring, and while you wait for October, check out our previous books on the history of Street Fighter 2 and Final Fantasy 7.

Your Apple TV may have become one of the best retro gaming devices out there overnight,"The RetroArch video game emulation frontend was released on the iOS App Store yesterday, alongside popular PSP emulator PPSSPP (itself a core available in RetroArch). 
While the popular and more elegant Delta emulator emulates six Nintendo consoles for iOS at the moment, RetroArchâs somewhat unwieldy UI brings support for a wild 78 (!) emulators covering a wide range of console and computer systems. But it also brings one other notable feature: Itâs the first emulator to be released for Appleâs tvOS App Store, as spotted by MacStoriesâ Sigmund Judge. 
And thatâs all because of a historic change in policy from Apple. In March, the company released an iOS update that included concessions to comply with the European Unionâs Digital Markets Act (DMA), which forced the tech giant to open its platform to alternative app marketplaces in Europe. Of course, one reason a user might travel outside of Appleâs walled garden would be to acquire a video game emulator, and Apple changed a long-standing policy to allow video game emulators a month later, in an effort to head off that eventuality.
Before RetroArchâs release, it was technically possible to use game emulators on Apple TV via AirPlay, effectively casting Delta to the Apple TV. But native support means no casting latency, and the ability to use an actual gamepad instead of your phoneâs slippery glass screen. With RetroArch, youâll be able to play games from classic Sega systems like the Master System, Genesis and Saturn, as well as more obscure consoles like the Watara Supervision. 
A post shared by The Verge (@verge)
As access to video game emulators becomes simpler, and the hardware more capable of providing a high quality experience â like playing Sega Genesis games on an Apple TV for example â the emulation community, and the platforms that they are being distributed on, are creating a moment similar to that of the iPod in the early aughts. The technology existed to play MP3 files, but it wasnât until the iPodâs release that it became truly mainstream. And once playing MP3s was easy, the question of where you got all those MP3s from in the first place changed music distribution forever, first with the iTunes Store and later streaming services like Spotify. 
You can find RetroArch, Delta, and PPSSPP on the App Store today. And if youâre so inclined, let us know in the comments if youâre interested in using your Apple TV for retro games.

EAâs college football video game returns in July after an 11-year hiatus,"We finally know when weâre going back to school: EA Sports College Football 25 is scheduled to launch July 19, publisher Electronic Arts announced Thursday.
EA also officially released the gameâs cover artwork, which had leaked online last week, confirming that College Football 25 will feature three current players on the box: Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter, and Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards.
This is the first time that active college athletes will grace the cover of an EA Sports game, EA said in a news release. And thanks to the new post-2021 landscape in college sports, where athletes can be compensated for the use of their name, image, and likeness, the game publisher is paying each of this yearâs cover stars for the appearance. (Edwards, Ewers, and Hunter have each published sponsored Instagram posts in partnership with the official EA Sports College Football account.)
Developed, as before, by Madden NFL studio EA Tiburon, the game will be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The lack of a Windows PC version is notable, since EA has been releasing Madden on PC since 2018. But itâs unlikely to dampen the anticipation and enthusiasm around College Football 25 all that much, considering how long fans have been waiting for this beloved video game franchise to return.
Itâs been more than a decade since EA shelved the series, then known as NCAA Football, amid a flurry of class-action lawsuits alleging that EA, the NCAA, and the Collegiate Licensing Company (an organization representing the schools that appeared in the game) profited from their use of collegiate athletesâ likenesses without paying them. This arrangement existed due to long-standing NCAA bylaws that characterized the players as âstudent-athletesâ â as opposed to professionals â and forbade them from receiving any compensation for the use of their names, images, or likenesses (NIL). In separate litigation, former college athletes alleged that this practice violated antitrust law.
EA, the NCAA, and the CLC agreed in 2014 to settlements totaling $60 million for the use of athlete likenesses in video games, which resulted in payouts to thousands of former players who had âappearedâ in EAâs college football and college basketball games. The antitrust litigation eventually ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously in 2021 in NCAA v. Alston that the NCAAâs limits on compensation for athletes were illegal, while leaving in place policies that prevent them from being paid salaries. Shortly afterward, the NCAA announced an interim NIL policy, opening the floodgates for collegiate athletes to be able to sign endorsement deals with companies such as EA.
While EAâs video game franchise no longer carries the NCAA name â the publisher rebranded it to EA Sports College Football when it announced the seriesâ return in 2021 â it appears that College Football 25 will include all the pomp and pageantry from college football, and the authenticity that people were accustomed to. EA said in its news release that the game will feature 134 colleges and universities from the NCAAâs Football Bowl Subdivision, meaning that players will be able to enjoy their favorite schoolâs uniforms, mascots, and stadiums as they did in EAâs previous games. And now that NIL deals are possible, College Football 25âs cover stars are among more than 10,000 collegiate athletes who have agreed to appear in the game. EA is giving each one a minimum fee of $600, plus a copy of the game.
There are a few different ways to get College Football 25, including a new bundle. The base game on PS5 and Xbox Series X will cost $69.99; pre-order bonuses consist of three items for Ultimate Team, the fantasy team mode featuring virtual trading cards. The Deluxe Edition, which includes a host of additional Ultimate Team content and three daysâ worth of early access, will cost $99.99.
EA is also offering a package called the MVP Bundle, which will give buyers access to the deluxe editions of both College Football 25 and this yearâs Madden game (which, perhaps surprisingly, will be called Madden NFL 25). The bundle costs $149.99, which represents a savings of $50 over buying the special editions separately. As for Madden NFL 25, itâs scheduled to launch Aug. 16 on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
More details on College Football 25 will be unveiled Friday, alongside a full trailer.
Update: Weâve added details about College Football 25âs various editions to this story.",https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports,2024-05-16 15:15:00
Los Angeles Chargers win the NFL release schedule meme wars with a maniacal Sims video,"The Los Angeles Chargers have chosen to begin their announcement of the NFL schedule in the most incredible way: Putting a bunch of other teamsâ fans in a swimming pool and removing the ladder â in The Sims 2, of course. 
You may remember the Chargersâ schedule release video from last year, when the social media team made the schedule into an anime, complete with references to One Piece, Naruto, and Attack on Titan. Largely, schedule release videos have been extremely boring â itâs literally just the 17-game schedule for the upcoming season, put into video format. NFL teams are trying to inject pop culture into the mix, like when the Detroit Lions put their schedule in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and schedule release season is turning into a meme war. The Chargers are one team that routinely excels, and the Sims 2 video makes this year no different.
should we REALLY make our schedule release video in the sims?yes          yes          yesyesyesyes    yes      yes         yesyes  yes  yes     yes           yesyes    yesyes     yes           yesyes      yesye      yes        yesyes          yes           yesyes pic.twitter.com/MXzfAPyhe8
There are so many incredible Easter eggs throughout the whole video. Itâs got Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce; New York Jets quarterback and famed conspiracy theorist Aaron Rodgers recoiling from a cellphone tower; Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker in the kitchen following a misogynistic, homophobic commencement speech; and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver George Pickens watching himself getting drafted (also featuring the box of stolen Pittsburgh Penguins Jaromir JÃ¡gr bobbleheads). Thatâs literally not even the half of it, so youâre going to want to watch and analyze for yourself.
Itâs the clear frontrunner for release videos this year, but several other NFL teams had fun referencing pop culture. The Atlanta Falcons turned their schedule release video into ATL Streets Vol. â24, a play on NFL Street from 2004. The Jacksonville Jaguars went with a reference to X-Men â97, while the Seattle Seahawks did a fun comic book style announcement.
But has anyone lived up to the Chargers social media teamâs schedule release legacy? My guess is no.",https://www.polygon.com/24158120/los-angeles-chargers-the-sims-schedule-release-meme,2024-05-16 14:31:04

Japanese Switch Online players just got an important piece of Zelda history,"While here in the US the Nintendo Switch Online service got three new Mario games this week (yes, Alleyway is a Mario game), the update for Japan included a bonus classic you may not have heard of. Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru (officially translated as The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls) was a Japanese Game Boy release, co-developed by the familiar tag-team of Nintendo R&D1 and Intelligent Systems, responsible for much of the Game Boyâs lineup. And while The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls may not be a household name, if youâre a fan of The Legend of Zelda: Linkâs Awakening (and who isnât?) you should take the time to play it.
âLinkâs Awakeningâs development story is retold time and time again, but whatâs almost always left out is that itâs built directly on top of [...] Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru,â Nintendo Lifeâs Jon Cartwright details in this excellent video. That is really apparent when you see the game in motion. From the engine to the font to the transition from top-down to side-scrolling, The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls should look familiar.
Something else should look familiar to those of you who have played Linkâs Awakening. Prince Richard, the weird guy with the frogs living in Pothole Field, who asks you to help him find his five Golden Leaves? That character is actually from The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls, and even the music that plays in his villa is a variation on that gameâs theme. Hereâs a description from Marc Normandinâs fun RetroXP newsletter: 
Prince Richard is actually not the protagonist of For the Frog the Bell Tolls, but is instead the best friend of him. The protagonist is the Prince of Sable, named and controlled by you. The adventure begins with the two princes (oh no) finding out that a princess is in trouble and must be saved, leading to the two trying to race the other to the finish line.
Another familiar face for the Smash Bros. fans out there is the aforementioned Prince Sable, who shows up as an Assist Trophy, using his frog and snake powers. Oh right, about those, again from Normandin:
Prince Sable can transform into a frog or a snake, and eventually, can do so basically at will. A witch turns Prince Richard and his men â who arrived to save Princess Tiramisu from Delarin first â into frogs, and then later on, turns the Prince of Sable into a frog as well.
If you donât live in Japan or donât read Japanese, donât worry! An English fan translation was created in 2011, which can be applied to a copy of the ROM . (Or, if you prefer, here is an updated version that changes the title from For the Frog the Bell Tolls to Nintendoâs now âofficialâ translation The Frog for Whom the Bell Tolls.) As far as how to apply patches to ROM files, or how to dump a cartridge to obtain a ROM file, I will leave that up to you and your ability to search the internet. From there, you just need to find a suitable emulator â and these days even iPhones are in on the game.

3 Body Problem renewed for season 2 â and however many more seasons it needs to wrap,"Netflixâs adaptation of Cixin Liuâs novel The Three-Body Problem and its sequels is coming back for a second season, and potentially more, the streaming service announced on Wednesday. It seems that the renewal is for however many seasons the series needs to wrap up. The announcement came with a quote from the seriesâ showrunners thatâs focused on the end of the series, though they donât specify how many seasons that might involve. 
âWeâre thrilled that we get to tell this story through to its epic conclusion. Ever since we read the last page of Cixin Liuâs magnificent trilogy, we hoped weâd be able to bring the audience to the end of the universe with us. Here we go!â said a statement Netflix posted on X, credited to showrunners David Benioff, D.B. Weiss, and Alexander Woo. 
According to Variety, Netflix also said it will announce at a later date just how many episodes and seasons are left in the 3 Body Problem, but for now, it seems like we can trust that the creative team behind the show will get to finish telling the story. While this isnât a massive surprise, considering how popular the first season was, Netflix has a reputation for cancelling shows just as theyâre getting going. So the assurance that weâll get a real ending for 3 Body Problem should be reassuring to fans who have been burned by Netflix cancellations in the past. 
As for how many seasons the show might end up running, that remains up for debate. Given that the first season of the show covered the entire first book in the trilogy, as well as parts of books two and three, itâs entirely possible that Benioff, Weiss, and Woo could finish up the story in season 2. However it seems more likely that the show will run for three or four seasons, if Benioffâs previous quotes are to be believed. 
Thereâs no word yet on when 3 Body Problem will return to Netflix, though itâs likely that it wonât happen until 2025 at the earliest. ",https://www.polygon.com/24157604/3-body-problem-season-2-renewal-ending-seasons,2024-05-15 20:22:38
"Ubisoft cancels The Division Heartland, the latest AAA free-to-play game casualty","Ubisoft has ended development of The Division Heartland, the free-to-play game set in the universe of Tom Clancyâs The Division, the company announced Wednesday. The game was announced in 2021. The publisher said it will divert resources elsewhere, specifically to XDefiant and the Rainbow Six franchise.
The Division Heartland was set in the wake of a devastating pandemic that ravaged the fictional flyover town of Silver Creek. In the multiplayer game, developed by Red Storm Entertainment, players would have to cope with an ever-changing contamination, new survival obligations, and a deadly nighttime cycle in the free-to-play spinoff of The Division franchise. Ubisoft made a big showing of Heartland at its Division Day event last year, and conducted closed playtests of the game. But it appears that the publisher is following the direction of many other publishers who are canceling in-development projects or giving up on free-to-play live-service games.
In recent months, multiple AAA publishers and studios have canceled their in-development live-service games. That includes the long-in-development The Last of Us Online at Naughty Dog and Blizzard Entertainmentâs untitled fantasy survival game. And just last week, Microsoft ended further development on Redfall inline with the closure of Arkane Austin.
Still, The Division Heartlandâs cancellation stands out, considering the publisherâs commitment to troubled projects like Skull and Bones â which had a decade-long development cycle â and the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake. But diverting more resources to XDefiant may be just what that delayed, substantially reworked Tom Clancy game needs.
Ubisoft has two other announced The Division projects in the works: The Division Resurgence, a free-to-play multiplayer third-person shooter mobile game, and The Division 3, which Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft confirmed was in the works last September.
The Division Heartland is one of many cancellations Ubisoft has confirmed in recent years. In 2023, the company canceled three unannounced titles alongside Immortals Fenyx Rising 2. The year prior, it slashed four in-development projects that werenât publicly announced.
Ubisoftâs lineup for the next year now includes Assassinâs Creed Shadows (officially revealed earlier today), Rainbow Six Mobile, Star Wars Outlaws, The Division Resurgence, and XDefiant.",https://www.polygon.com/24157512/tom-clancys-division-heartland-canceled-ubisoft,2024-05-15 19:44:00
Red Dead Redemption 2 returns to PlayStation Plus in May offerings,"PlayStation Plus is Sonyâs equivalent of Xboxâs Game Pass service, and games come and go from the catalog over time. While not every game is on the service, and some rotate out, itâs still an excellent way to play a selection of great games from the last decade. For instance, Rockstarâs epic cowboy saga Red Dead Redemption 2 will soon be available on PlayStation Plus after a long absence, along with a handful of other intriguing titles.
The May lineup for PlayStation Plusâ game catalog (arriving May 21) includes Red Dead, as well as the spy vs spy royale Deceive Inc., co-op crime heister Crime Boss: Rockay City, adorable cat-themed classic RPGs Cat Quest and Cat Quest 2, and survival simulator Stranded: Alien Dawn. Thatâs a smorgasbord of well-received games that can be sampled, which is a nice perk of PlayStation Plus.
Red Dead Redemption 2 has a long campaign, but one thatâs well worth exploring. The story of Arthur Morgan and the van der Linde gang is a slow motion trainwreck, with their criminal camaraderie slowly cracking under the pressure of the encroaching civilization and law that comes with it. In addition, Red Dead Online is a fun cowboy sandbox with a much more light-hearted tone, and it comes as part of the package with Red Dead Redemption 2 (though itâs no longer being updated).
When the PlayStation Plus content library is refreshed, players lose access to titles that have been removed from the service. So if youâre playing Horizon Zero Dawn or another title set to be removed through PlayStation Plus, you have until May 21 to wrap up. Thereâs a section marked âlast chance to playâ under the Collections page on the PlayStation 5, or the Games Catalog page on the PlayStation 4.

"Ubisoft reveals Assassinâs Creed Shadows, its long-awaited feudal Japan game","Ubisoft gave Assassinâs Creed fans their first real look at the next flagship game in the long-running franchise with the debut trailer for Assassinâs Creed Shadows on Wednesday. Previously known as Assassinâs Creed: Codename Red, Shadows will send the franchise to feudal Japan for the first time this November, letting players live out their shinobi fantasies as the ninja Naoe.
Assassinâs Creed Shadows will also let players take on a second role, that of legendary Black samurai Yasuke. While other Assassinâs Creed games have featured dual protagonists, the two playable characters of Shadows appear to be more distinct than those of any previous game. The gameâs female ninja character is shown wielding ninjato, wristblade, and kusarigama; her samurai counterpart is a heavily armored fella with a hefty katana.
The debut trailer for Assassinâs Creed Shadows teased its cinematic ambitions and introduced its characters. Fans may need to wait until Ubisoft Forward in June for a look at actual gameplay.
Assassinâs Creed Shadows is being developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind 2018âs Assassinâs Creed Odyssey, under the creative direction of Jonathan Dumont. Shadows was originally announced in 2022 under its codename, and promised to send the Assassinâs Creed franchise to one of fansâ most-requested settings.
Shadows is the open-world RPG follow-up to last yearâs Assassinâs Creed Mirage, the scaled-back take on the 17-year-old Assassinâs Creed formula. The feudal Japan-set game is just one of multiple announced projects in the works for the Assassinâs Creed publisher. Others include Assassinâs Creed Jade, a mobile game set in Chinaâs Qin dynasty, and the mysterious Assassinâs Creed Codename: Hexe, âa very different type of Assassinâs Creed game,â according to Ubisoft executive producer Marc-Alexis Cote. Hexe is being overseen by creative director Clint Hocking (Watch Dogs: Legion, Far Cry 2). 
Elsewhere, thereâs Assassinâs Creed Codename: Infinity, which is ânot a game per se,â Cote said in 2022, but âa hub that will unite all our different experiences and players in meaningful ways.â
Assassinâs Creed Shadows is coming to Mac, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X on Nov. 15.",https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red,2024-05-15 16:01:00
Nintendo Switch Onlineâs new update is quietly 3 classic Mario games,"Nintendoâs latest additions to the Nintendo Switch Online lineup of Game Boy games is led by Super Mario Land, the 1989 platformer made exclusively for the companyâs handheld system. Super Mario Land is joined by two other Game Boy launch titles now available for Nintendo Switch Online, and theyâre both Mario games too.
Alleyway is Nintendo and Intelligent Systemsâ take on classic brick-breaking games like  Breakout and Arkanoid. Itâs less obviously a Mario game, though the Super Mario brother is featured on the gameâs box art and thereâs even a little in-game animation of Mario hopping into the paddle-ship to drive home that, yes, one of the plumberâs many jobs is slamming energy balls on the Vid-Grid. Various sprites based on Bloobers, Bullet Bills, and Bowser also serve as the design for the blocky structures you need to smash.
(Why is Mario in a spaceship in the mysterious zone known as the Alleyway smashing stuff? The Game Boy gameâs manual never says, but it probably has something to do with Nintendo wanting to position Alleyway as something more than a Breakout clone.)
Mario is also featured in the Game Boy version of Baseball thatâs now available through Nintendo Switch Online. Heâs featured front and center in the North American version of the box art, and is included among the pitching staff for the USAâs White Bears. Luigi is a pitcher on the Red Eagles team, though Baseball uses a common sprite for all pitchers â they donât look anything like Mario and Luigi in the game itself.
Those three Game Boy launch titles are now available to play with a Nintendo Switch Online membership. They join Tetris, another Game Boy launch classic, as well as 20 other 8-bit handheld games.
Nintendo Switch Online costs $19.99 annually, and in addition to online multiplayer access, gives Switch owners a library of games from the original NES, Super NES, and Game Boy. A second tier, Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, is the premium upgrade to Nintendoâs online subscription service, and offers a variety of expansions and downloadable content and access to a library of Game Boy Advance, Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis games. Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack costs $49.99 annually for an individual user, and $79.99 annually for a family plan (for up to eight users).

Why did Kickstarter pull down 2 high-profile tabletop campaigns this month?,"Late last year, Polygon showed that Kickstarterâs earnings from tabletop games were down for the second straight year, an abrupt change following more than a decade of uninterrupted growth. Our analysis also showed that the number of successful campaigns was up sharply compared to previous years. Now two high-profile campaigns, both removed from the website for different reasons, show how this increase in velocity may be straining the Brooklyn-based crowdfunding pioneerâs resources.
The first campaign that Kickstarter elected to bring down was for a game called Forsaken, a sandbox adventure board game from the team at Game Trayz. On May 7, Game Trayz explained that a legal dispute over 10 pieces of art had thrown a wrench in production. According to a statement provided by Kickstarter, the artist in question issued a copyright claim through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) that obligated the platform to pull the campaign down. After Game Trayz swapped out the art, however, Kickstarter was able to return the campaignâs web page to the internet. All in all itâs nothing that unusual, and similar issues have gotten campaigns pulled down plenty of times in the past.
However, the issue with Wonders of the First, a new collectible card game that features art created using commercially available artificial intelligence tools, was considerably more complex. 
When the CCG launched on April 30, the project met its funding goal in less than 30 seconds. Itâs a testament to the fledgling teamâs ability to get its backers in line on day one. The momentum continued to build, until by the end of the first week the campaign was closing in on $1.5 million â quite the haul for a first-time effort. 
Given the attention being paid to AI on the global stage, that haul also brought intense scrutiny from all around. Many on social media and in the campaignâs comments were there to complain about the use of AI art. Like it or not, thatâs something Kickstarter has allowed since 2023. But the campaign got pulled down anyway, not because of AI but because of expressly prohibited items: non-fungible tokens, also known as NFTs.
In a statement provided to Polygon, Kickstarter said that NFTs simply arenât allowed on its platform citing a rule against offering âfinancial services, money processing, credit offerings, travel packages, phone services, and business marketing servicesâ to backers. Reached for comment, the publishers of Wonders of the First reiterated that they believed the wording of that rule was unclear. But, after a bit of grandstanding, they eventually removed the NFTs and Kickstarter allowed them to relaunch the campaign.
But why was a campaign that offered prohibited items allowed to go live in the first place? According to a statement provided by Kickstarter, as the number of campaigns launched each year continues to increase its oversight team is having a difficult time keeping up.
âWe conduct initial reviews of all projects before they go live on Kickstarter to ensure they comply with our community guidelines and terms of service,â said the Kickstarter spokesperson. âHowever, given the large volume of project submissions we receive daily and the fact that projects can evolve or new information may emerge, our job doesnât end with these initial reviews. In the case of this project, our continued monitoring and review processes later identified a violation. We take these subsequent reviews seriously to ensure all projects comply with our guidelines. Itâs a reflection of our commitment to maintaining the integrity of our platform.â
Given the trajectory of Kickstarterâs business, we expect the company to field more tabletop campaigns this year than ever before â at least 5,500 successful tabletop campaigns alone. Thatâs more than 15 successful campaigns every day. With that kind of volume, and with campaigns this complex, there is every potential that backers will see more disruption going forward.

Duneâs prequel TV show looks like it could actually live up to the movies,"Sci-fi and fantasy epics on television have come a long way in the last several years, but you could be forgiven for finding it hard to believe that Maxâs upcoming Dune prequel series could live up to the majesty of Denis Villeneuveâs massive movies. However, the Dune: Prophecy trailer, which came out on Wednesday morning, is here to prove you wrong. 
The new series is set 10,000 years before the birth of Paul Atreides, and will follow the early days of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood as it attempts to dig its claws into the social fabric of the galaxy. This means that the series will likely include significantly more of that palace intrigue, back-stabbings, and backroom deals that the recent Dune movies only hint at. And since this show is also on Max, itâs at least a little hard not to think of this as Game of Thrones (or more accurately House of the Dragon) in space, which is a pretty enticing premise. 
Despite being a prequel set long before Villeneuveâs movies, the world here looks surprisingly similar. The rooms in the trailer have the same beautiful angularity, with ornate walls and harsh lights that are perfect for the Bene Gesserit to sneak around in. Even more importantly, the trailer makes this all look beautiful in a way that hopefully bodes well for the show as a whole. 
Dune: Prophecy will star Emily Watson (Gosford Park), Travis Fimmel (Vikings), Mark Strong (1917), and Olivia Williams (The Sixth Sense, Rushmore). The series is created by Diana Ademu-John (The Haunting of Bly Manor), and will be directed by Anna Foster (Outlander), John Cameron (Legion, Fargo), and Richard J. Lewis (Westworld), with music from Volker Bertelmann (All Quiet on the Western Front). Dune: Prophecy is set for release this fall on Max.",https://www.polygon.com/24157308/dunes-prophecy-prequel-tv-series-max,2024-05-15 15:31:07
Hi-Fi Rush gets one last patch before studio closure,"Tango Gameworks will update Hi-Fi Rush one last time before Microsoft shuts the door on the studio. Microsoft announced earlier in May that it was closing three studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks. Shortly after the news of the closures, Tango Gameworks confirmed the game will âremain available and playable everywhereâ it's already accessible.
The final patch is expected to fix âminor issuesâ in Hi-Fi Rush, and will be deployed later on Wednesday. Tango Gameworks will continue to work in partnership with Limited Run Games to release the physical version of the game. âThank you all for your continued support,â Tango Gameworks posted from its X account.
Microsoftâs decision to close Tango Gameworks came as a surprise to many in the industry; the Japanese studio surprise launched the game early last year to critical and â what seemed like â commercial success. Xbox marketing director Aaron Greenberg posted on X in April 2023 that Hi-Fi Rush was âa breakout hitâ in âall key measurements and expectationsâ at Microsoft. Just a day after the closure was announced, Xbox Game Studios lead Matt Booty told staff that Microsoft needed âsmaller games that give us prestige and awardsâ â a message that was surprising to employees, according to The Verge, because Hi-Fi Rush is exactly that. Hi-Fi Rush had 3 million players and won plenty of awards, including a prestigious BAFTA win for its animation.
Hi-Fi Rush fans showed their displeasure with the closure by review bombing the game on Valveâs Steam platform â but opposite of how itâs usually done. Review bombing is usually a negative act â people attempting to tank a gameâs review score on a platform like Steam. But Hi-Fi Rush players added more than 2,000 positive reviews to Steam in an attempt to show Microsoft how much they loved it and to thank Tango Gameworks for their work. Several reviewers commented on the ironic nature of the studioâs closure: Hi-Fi Rush is âa power fantasy about tearing down an evil corporation whose executives treat workers like fodder in the endless pursuit of wealth,â as Polygon said in its review.
Hi-Fi Rush was originally an Xbox exclusive, but was released on PlayStation 5 in 2024. Itâll remain available on all current platforms, despite the studioâs closure.",https://www.polygon.com/24157264/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-studio-closure,2024-05-15 15:22:15
"Netflixâs Terminator anime takes the cyborg time war to Tokyo, with a new AI twist","Netflix and anime studio Production IGâs take on the Terminator arrives this summer, marking a big year for James Cameronâs killer cyborgs. Terminator: Zero will be a somewhat-familiar time-travelling tale with a twist: While we have our standard future warrior sent to the past to protect humanity from killing machines, there will also be a new protector in the form of an AI designed to battle Skynetâs genocidal ambitions.
Terminator: Zeroâs hero is an as-yet unnamed soldier sent back in time to change humanityâs fate. She travels from a war-ravaged 2022 to 1997 Tokyo to protect a scientist named Malcolm Lee, whoâs developing a rival AI system to fend off Skynetâs attack on humanity. âAs Malcolm navigates the moral complexities of his creation,â Netflix said in a new synopsis for the animated series, âhe is hunted by an unrelenting assassin from the future which forever alters the fate of his three children.â
As Netflixâs first images of Terminator: Zero reveal, Leeâs Skynet competitor is presented as something we havenât seen in the live-action Terminator films before: a virtual maiden.
Netflix also revealed images of its stand in for Kyle Reese â who is reportedly not part of the Sarah Connor lineage, since the animeâs showrunner says this is not a Connor family story â and what sheâll be battling: your standard T-800 Terminator model disguised as a human being.
When it was originally announced in 2021, showrunner and executive producer Mattson Tomlin said the anime series would âapproach Terminator in a way that breaks conventions, subverts expectations, and has real guts.â Tomlinâs credits include writing the stories for Matt Reevesâ The Batman (and its sequel) and Netflixâs Project Power. Production I.G, the veteran anime production studio known for its work on series like Ghost in the Shell, Haikyu!!, and Psycho-Pass, is lending its creative talents to adapt The Terminator for animation. The eight-episode series is directed by Masashi Kudo (Bleach, Chain Chronicle).
Terminator: Zero will premiere on Netflix on Aug. 29.
Two months later, Terminator fans will get their hands on a big new survival game based on the franchise. Naconâs Terminator: Survivors will launch in early access on Steam for Windows PC on Oct. 24, just days before the 40th anniversary of the franchiseâs launch. Survivors is also coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at a later date.",https://www.polygon.com/anime/23164952/terminator-zero-netflix-anime-release-date-first-look,2024-05-15 14:00:00
"Valheim heats up with new, ultra-deadly biome in Ashlands update","Valheim is a fantastic sandbox survival game, set in a fantastical 10th realm of the Norse afterlife. Adventurers explore from the peaceful meadows out into more dangerous biomes, and today, the most dangerous one yet is available to explore. The last biome update was the Mistlands; today, players can venture out into the Ashlands.
Of course, thatâs much easier said than done, since the Ashlands is a very hostile environment. Vikings will need to build ships strong enough to survive its boiling waters, and things donât get better upon landfall. Undead known as Charred wander the lands, a fearsome Fallen Valkyrie attacks from the skies, and a beastly creature known as the Morgen hunts prey, along with other enemies. 
Luckily, new enemies means new loot, which can be turned into new weapons. Flametal can be crafted into a new greatsword, spear, and crossbow, and further enhanced with jade, bloodstone, and isoite gems. Building outposts in the Ashlands is meant to feel like a constant struggle, and the Charred control the territory from fortresses. Luckily, players can now craft siege weaponry. Catapults and battering rams allow players to attack fortresses directly, expanding their reach over the new biome.
âAshlands is supposed to feel like a struggle, and players should expect a challenge. Every inch of territory you claim has to be earned, and every outpost has to be reinforced before you venture deeper. Weâre entering endgame territory here, and players need to be ready for what comes in the Deep North,â said Andreas Tomasson, Valheim producer, in a press release.
Valheim is available on PC, and is still in early access. The Viking survival game had a huge launch in 2021, thanks to developer Iron Gateâs ability to craft a compelling range of experiences across the biomes, from cozy and comfortable to striving for survival. The game has remained relevant through to 2024, attracting an audience of survival game fans. The Mistlands update expanded the game with a mysterious, mountainous region with low visibility and insectoid enemies, but the Ashlands sounds like a whole new level of danger.",https://www.polygon.com/24156665/valheim-firelands-update-live-new-biome-siege-weapons-charred,2024-05-14 19:16:01
Dead by Daylightâs next Killer is Dungeons & Dragons baddie Vecna,"Dead by Daylight is a game absolutely packed with murderous monsters, both original and licensed from other franchises. The next crossover is a little bit outside of the usual horror wheelhouse â Dead by Daylight is producing a chapter themed around the wildly popular tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons. Vecna, known in-game as The Lich, will be the gameâs next Killer. Vecna is joined by a pair of Elven bards, one male and one female, who will serve as the new Survivors. 
Behaviour Interactive announced the crossover during the gameâs anniversary stream Tuesday, which included sneak peeks of other titles in the same universe and a new 2v8 gameplay mode.
Vecna is a powerful mage, with access to an array of spells. He can fly, summon spectral entities, create a mage hand to manipulate items, and dispel magic. While most Killers in Dead by Daylight focus on throwing hatchets or swinging a blade, Vecna uses magical abilities to hunt down Survivors. Luckily, thereâs an upside to facing him as an enemy. When Vecna is the Killer, he spawns chests around the map. Opening them starts a dice roll, and if the player is lucky enough, they can obtain some of Vecnaâs legendary loot. 
The Eye and Hand of Vecna can be obtained from these chests. The Eye of Vecna grants invisibility to Survivors after they leave a locker, while the Hand of Vecna allows you to teleport between lockers. If you roll a critical failure, Behaviour promises something terrible happens â but we donât know what quite yet.
With the runaway success of Baldurâs Gate 3, as well as the recent Dungeons & Dragons movie, itâs interesting to see Dungeons & Dragons expand even further by entering the illustrious cast of the asymmetrical horror game. Stranger Things, a show no stranger to D&D tie-ins, based its season four antagonist on Vecna, and they even share the same name â so maybe heâll form a special bond with Stranger Thingsâ Dead by Daylight Killer, the Demogorgon, who was similarly named after a D&D monster.
Behaviour also teased the next licensed chapter, which will be a cross-over with the Castlevania franchise. We donât know who the Killer or Survivor will be for that, but we can expect details later this summer. The stream also shared that a third licensed chapter will arrive before the end of Dead by Daylightâs next anniversary.
For fans who prefer the original aspects of Dead by Daylight, Behaviour shared a look at some other games in the same universe. The Casting of Frank Stone is a branching narrative game from Until Dawn developer Supermassive, similar to The Quarry or the Dark Pictures Anthology. A two-player co-op title called What the Fog is also briefly available for free with the registration of a Behaviour account, and it looks like a much cuter and absurd take on the Entityâs Realm.
The Dungeons & Dragons DLC is coming to the test realm today, and the chapter will release on live servers on June 3.",https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24155430/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover-vecna,2024-05-14 16:42:23
The Megalopolis trailer might be the coolest thing Iâve ever seen,"Megalopolis, legendary director Francis Ford Coppolaâs first film in 14 years, is one of 2024âs most notable movies for two reasons. First, it is the decades-in-development self-funded passion project of a cinematic titan, and second, no one wants to distribute it. On paper, thatâs plenty baffling, but it only becomes more so when you see what the film looks like. 
An urban fantasy about an idealist who seeks to rebuild a New York City-like metropolis into a utopia following a disaster, the trailer is mostly a montage of dreams and decadence. Statues walk, chariots race in Madison Square Garden, and Adam Driver ruminates on the nature of utopias. 
At just a minute and a half, the trailer is awe-inspiring (even on a phone screen), with little context for the narrative. Itâs the platonic ideal of movie marketing: Win, lose or draw, the trailer sells Megalopolis as something that must be seen, preferably in a theater. Letâs hope that after the film premieres at this yearâs Cannes Film Festival, we get the chance to see it, and very soon at that.

House of the Dragon season 2 trailer has SO many freaking dragons and houses,"After making fans wage war by picking which of two trailers to watch on YouTube, HBO is back with a new trailer for House of the Dragon season 2 that promises things will go quite badly no matter who your fave is. Thatâs the Westeros Promise, baby!
While the first season skipped through time, season 2 looks like itâs settling in for the long haul. The new episodes seem to depict the immediate fallout from last season, when Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) was installed as king in a coup over Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma DâArcy), kicking off the Targaryen Civil War, aka the Dance of the Dragons.
The new trailer shows off both sides of the Worst Family Ever amassing supporters and dragons, promising tons of sexy intrigue and backstabbing in addition to big, brutal battles atop horse and dragon. Frankly, it looks pretty spectacular, and even if the we know where this story ends, getting there seems like itâs gonna be a hell of a ride. 
House of the Dragon season 2 premieres on HBO and Max on June 16.

How to watch Warhammer Skulls 2024,"Games Workshop will broadcast updates on the various video games under the Warhammer umbrella during its yearly Warhammer Skulls presentation. This is the eighth Warhammer Skulls event, and itâll take place on May 23 on the official Warhammer Twitch stream. The stream will begin at 12 p.m. EDT/9 a.m. PDT.
Luckily, weâre currently in a golden age of Warhammer-related video games. If youâre a fan of shooters, thereâs the tongue-in-cheek retro-inspired Boltgun, or the visceral and frenetic co-op horde shooter Darktide. Weâll likely get more information on Space Marine 2, the long awaited sequel to Captain Titusâs Ork-stomping adventure. This time, the Ultramarine will be going up against Tyranids and the Thousand Sons.
We can also likely expect news on Rogue Trader, the sprawling CRPG from Owlcat Games. Rogue Trader is set to receive narrative DLC packs, so we may get to meet some new companions or explore new facets of the Koronus Expanse. 
These games all take place in the Warhammer 40,000 setting, but the Warhammer franchise includes the Horus Heresy, a prequel series to the sci-fi behemoth, as well as the Age of Sigmar and Warhammer Fantasy settings. These have played host to some great games, like the Blood Bowl series, Vermintide, or the Total War: Warhammer games. 
Warhammer is a massive hobby, spanning across tabletop games, animations, novels, audio plays, a forthcoming Amazon series headed by Henry Cavill, and video games. Thereâs room for a lot of interesting news to emerge during Warhammer Skulls, and and the festival will continue on past the announcement showcase on May 23 through May 30.",https://www.polygon.com/24155435/warhammer-skulls-2024-video-game-showcase-date-start-time,2024-05-14 16:00:00

Chants of Sennaar, the award-winning language puzzle game, lands May 16 but is far from the only major game coming to the service that day. Microsoft will also add Immortals of Aveum (a magic-based first-person shooter) and cloud gaming access for NHL 24.
Later in the month, expect a day-one release of Ninja Theoryâs Senuaâs Saga: Hellblade 2, but you wonât want to miss Immortals of Aveum or Chants of Sennaar either. As for NHL 24, console gamers got access in April, but itâll be available via cloud gaming now, too.
Hereâs when all the games are coming in the back half of May, and where you can play them.
Sadly, six games must leave the service, too. You have until May 31 to play the following games, one of which is Chicory: A Colorful Tale, named Polygonâs second best game of the year in 2021.
Xbox Game Pass costs $10.99 a month, while PC Game Pass costs $9.99 a month. PC Game Pass includes EA Play access, which offers another 70 games on PC. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, at $16.99 per month, gives subscribers access to everything â the PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass libraries, EA Play on both console and PC â as well as access to online multiplayer.

Sauron is definitely back in Rings of Power season 2 teaser,"If Amazon Studiosâ teaser trailer for the second season of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power has one thing to say, itâs that Sauron is back and itâs everybodyâs problem. 
The teaser checks in with most of our characters from season 1 â Elrond, Galadriel, Prince Durin, Arondir, Adar, and even the Stranger. In true âteaserâ fashion, itâs light on specific plot details, but a cascade of gold rings â perhaps nine? â and a conspicuously bejeweled ring in the hands of King Durin give a hint at the seasonâs arc. 
Rings of Powerâs first had a lot of scene setting to do, as Sauron wormed his way into the confidence of elven leadership and put his mitts all over the forging of their three rings of power. Season 2 seems to continue with the two other sets of rings â the seven for the dwarves âin their halls of stone,â and ânine for mortal men doomed to die.â 
Also: Thereâs a big eagle! He better talk like the ones in the books because I will not stand for another wave of âWhy didnât they just ride eagles to Mordor?â Iâve put in my time!

Helldivers 2 is PlayStationâs fastest-selling game ever,"In its latest financial report, Sony has revealed that Helldivers 2 â the scrappy co-op shooter turned online gaming sensation from Swedenâs Arrowhead Game Studios â is the fastest-selling game PlayStation has ever released.
Sony said Helldivers 2 sold 12 million copies in its first 12 weeks on sale, âsurpassing the record set by God of War RagnarÃ¶k in the same period after its release in 2022.â RagnarÃ¶k sold 11 million copies in the same time frame. Sony said Helldivers 2 sales âfar exceeded expectations.â
Helldivers 2âs release strategy was unusual for Sony. It released simultaneously on PS5 and PC, via Steam, and at $39.99 had a lower price than the majority of first-party releases from PlayStation Studios, the console-makerâs development and publishing arm. Sony usually prices its games at $59.99 and above, and waits for a year or more before releasing them on PC.
Thereâs no doubt that Steam contributed massively to Helldivers 2âs success. Sales analyst Mat Piscatella said that, in the gameâs launch month, nearly 60% of its sales came from Steam, and it only recently fell out of the top 10 most-played games on the platform. âThe game has become our biggest PC hit title to date, and as a multi-platform title, it also contributed significantly to sales and profit last quarter,â Sony said. 
No surprise, then, that Sony plans to release all live-service games simultaneously on PlayStation and Steam going forward. Itâs yet to make the same decision for its first-party single-player action games in franchises like Marvelâs Spider-Man, The Last of Us, and God of War, which are regarded as system-sellers for PlayStation consoles and currently held back as platform exclusives. You can be certain there will be spirited debates about the pros and cons of this policy within Sony after Helldivers 2âs success.
As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!It's crazy to think that there are more Helldivers than there are Swedes  What a massive achievement from everyone involved in realizing @Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,â¦
But Sonyâs push into multiplatform publishing with Helldivers 2 hasnât been an unqualified success. When Sony attempted to reinstate a dropped requirement for Steam players to link a PlayStation Network account, it was met with a storm of dissent, and ultimately had to drop the policy.
Elsewhere in Sonyâs financial report, the company revealed that PS5 console sales had reached 59 million, just behind the 60 million PS4s sold in the same period since its release. It expects PS5 sales to have peaked and to decline annually from here on out, though. Generally speaking, the financial picture for PlayStation is pretty rosy, with sales up 17% over the previous financial year â though itâs expecting a decline in the year ahead, with no major exclusive games to drive sales.
Sony also announced a new CEO for Sony Interactive Entertainment, which runs the PlayStation business â in fact, it announced two. Jim Ryanâs replacements will be Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino. Hulst, former boss of Guerrilla Games and current head of PlayStation Studios, will become CEO of the new Studio Business Group, with responsibility for game development and publishing as well as TV and film licensing. Nishino takes over as CEO of the Platform Business Group, running console hardware and services like PlayStation Network, sales and marketing, and third-party relations. Both men will report into the current interim CEO Hiroki Totoki in his role as board chairman.
It sounds like not much has changed here, with the hard-nosed Totoki (the probable architect of the recent PlayStation layoffs, even though Ryan signed them off) carving up the kingdom and still pulling the strings.

A new studio co-founded by Jake Solomon, the veteran game designer behind XCOM and Marvelâs Midnight Suns, will challenge Maxisâ enduring and dominant life simulation game series with a new, still-untitled game that focuses on âthe drama of modern life.â
Joining Solomon at his new game company Midsummer Studios are co-founder Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis) and ex-The Sims producer-director Grant Rodiek (aka âSimGuru Grantâ). Rodiek was previously game director on Project Rene, Maxisâ in-development follow-up to The Sims 4. At least a half dozen other former Firaxis game developers who worked on the XCOM games and Marvelâs Midnight Suns are also now at Midsummer Studios.
âThe best stories in games are written by the players,â Solomon said in a news release. âAt Midsummer weâre making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.â
Solomon left Firaxis in 2023, after more than two decades at the studio. Shortly after his departure, he expressed his interest in making a life-simulation game.
Midsummerâs game is entering an increasingly crowded field that has been mostly dominated by Electronic Artsâ The Sims franchise. Promising competitors include Life By You, an upcoming life sim from Paradox Interactive thatâs being helmed by Rod Humble (Second Life, The Sims 3); Paralives, the highly customizable indie âdoll houseâ life sim; and Palia, a cozy life sim with Stardew Valley vibes thatâs currently in beta. 
EA and Maxisâ Project Rene (aka The Sims 5) does not have a release window, as developers behind the game say they plan to show off their progress and factor in community input for several years. The Sims 4 launched in 2014 and went free to play in 2022, reaching more than 70 million players over the past decade.
Midsummer Studios has not announced a title, release window, or platforms for its debut life sim.",https://www.polygon.com/24155607/the-sims-midsummer-studios-jake-solomon-xcom,2024-05-14 13:00:00
Mark Hamillâs back as the Joker in MultiVersus,"The Joker is coming to MultiVersus as part of the fighting gameâs relaunch later this month, and actor Mark Hamill will reprise his role as the Clown Prince of Crime for the occasion. Developer Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games showed off Joker in a new gameplay trailer that contains another fun surprise: The Powerpuff Girls are coming to MultiVersus as well.
While we donât get to see Buttercup, Blossom, and Bubbles in action, the Powerpuff Girls are teased within the first few seconds of Mondayâs trailer for Joker. Presumably, theyâll fight as a team, Ã  la MultiVersusâ clever take on Tom and Jerry, but weâll have to wait for the girlsâ  full reveal to know for sure.
The Jokerâs a Mage-class character in MultiVersus terms, meaning heâs more of a ranged fighter who relies on weapons and gadgets to deal damage. In Jokerâs case, heâll join the roster armed with a pogo stick, spring-loaded boxing gloves, a rocket launcher, balloons, and cartoonish cannons. His first gameplay trailer also shows off some alternate looks, including Dark Prince Charming and the Batman Who Laughs.
Hamillâs return to the Joker role reunites him with his Batman: The Animated Series co-star Kevin Conroy, who voiced MultiVersusâ version of the Caped Crusader. Hamill never really stepped away from his version of Joker, voicing him in recent animated features and video games like Batman: The Killing Joke and Lego DC Super-Villains. (Hamill did not provide the voice for the new, younger, alternate-universe Joker in the recent Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League update.)
MultiVersus will return on May 28. The game has been offline for close to a year as developer Player First worked to retool the Smash Bros.-inspired brawler and create new content for it.
Joker will join a roster that also includes DCâs Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, and Black Adam; Scooby-Dooâs Shaggy and Velma; Looney Tunesâ Bugs Bunny, Tasmanian Devil, and Marvin the Martian; Game of Thronesâ Arya Stark; Tom and Jerry; Adventure Timeâs Finn the Human and Jake the Dog; Steven Universe and Garnet; Iron Giant; Space Jam: A New Legacyâs LeBron James; Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith; Gremlinsâ Gizmo and Stripe; and MultiVersusâ original character Reindog.",https://www.polygon.com/24155348/multiversus-joker-gameplay-mark-hamill-powerpuff-girls,2024-05-13 15:00:00
Square Enix is going âaggressivelyâ multiplatform after string of PS5 exclusives,"Square Enix has revealed a new business plan â titled âSquare Enix Reboots, and Awakensâ â that will see the publisher âaggressively pursueâ a multiplatform strategy for its biggest games across Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation, and Windows PC.
While Square Enix has long been active across a wide range of platforms, it has a tradition of signing exclusivity deals for its biggest releases, typically with Sony. This yearâs Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and last yearâs Final Fantasy 16 are currently exclusive to PlayStation 5, while games like Forspoken and the original Final Fantasy 7 Remake have been released across PlayStation and PC. Final Fantasy 14 has only just seen an Xbox release this past March, over a decade after it debuted on PC and PlayStation.
The wording of Square Enixâs new plan, released as part of the companyâs latest financial report, suggests that this strategy will soon be a thing of the past. Square Enix said its goal was to âbuild an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles,â especially regarding âmajor franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles.â The mention of âcatalog titlesâ suggests that previously exclusive games, like the Final Fantasy 7 series and Final Fantasy 16, may soon be coming to other platforms.
The move comes after reports suggested that both FF16 and FF7 Rebirth underperformed financially. Indeed, in its own report, Square Enix acknowledges âlow profitabilityâ in what it calls the âHD gamesâ segment â meaning medium- to big-budget games for console systems and PC â which is an alarming thing to say about the financial year in which these two perceived juggernauts in the companyâs most famous franchise were released.
Of course, Square Enix is not the only company wondering if platform exclusivity can work at all at scale anymore. Xbox has begun a controversial shift toward publishing its games on rival console platforms, while Sony is in the process of discovering the huge audience (as well as the potential pitfalls) that can it can find as a multiplatform publisher with Helldivers 2. Square Enixâs language about finding a wider audience for its games echoes that used by Microsoft to defend its own decision.
Other points in Square Enixâs plan â which covers the period from now through March 2027 â include a âshift from quantity to qualityâ from a publisher that has been known to flood the market with smaller releases. Qualityâs great, of course, but the plan to âregularly release AAA titles in [Square Enixâs] major franchisesâ sounds a little like the risk aversion and sequelitis that has set in at every major game publisher. Square Enix said it had canceled several games that did not fit its new strategy.
In addition, Square Enix said that it aims to concentrate on in-house development and restructure its internal studios, or âbusiness units,â to be more integrated â suggesting that the companyâs long era of fiefdoms led by powerful individual producers with big personalities may be coming to an end. Reports have suggested that the current setup can be disorganized and frustrating for employees, but thereâs no doubt that it also leads to games with a strong personal flavor. Whether or not Square Enix can keep the âbalance between the creativity of its individual employees and the management centered on the organization,â as it says it intends to, will be key.
Overall, the business plan paints a picture of a company in crisis mode seeking to reboot itself â and of a game industry where AAA budgets and platform exclusivity just donât mix anymore.
Update (May 14): Bloomberg journalist Takashi Mochizuki offered some context based on comments to press by Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu. Kiryu confirmed that both Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth fell short of their sales expectations, as did Foamstars, another PlayStation exclusive. Kiryu also reiterated a need to find a balance between âindividual creativity and organizational discipline.â
Shares in Square Enix fell steeply Tuesday over fears that the company doesnât have enough big games coming in the next couple of years â and that it will be a long while before the effects of the reorganization are seen.
Square Enix said:-FF16 sales fell short of expectations. Initial momentum was in line with expectations, but the games failed to reach FY goal as its momentum slowed. No updates from sales number last announced at 3 million-FF7 Rebirth sales fell short of expectations.

"GameStop will buy graded PokÃ©mon cards soon, says staff","GameStop may begin purchasing graded PokÃ©mon cards at a select number of retail locations soon, according to store associates. If true, the move would make the retailer one of the single largest buyers of graded collectibles with nearly 3,000 potential retail locations in the United States for consumers to sell their cards. Rumors first began circulating Thursday, via PokÃ©Beach. Polygon has reached out to GameStopâs press team for comment.
Polygon spoke with multiple GameStop locations on Friday in four different states â Arizona, Illinois, Florida, and New York. Stores in three of those states confirmed that the new offering had been communicated to them by their corporate office. Associates with knowledge of the program said that only cards graded by Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) would be accepted, that those cards must be graded eight or higher on that companyâs 10-point grading scale, and that no cards valued at more than $500 would be accepted in store.
None of the staff Polygon spoke to knew if, or when, those cards might be sold at retail.

The market for PokÃ©mon, new and old, picked up during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, a number of high-profile PokÃ©mon card sales have raised the profile of these particular collectibles. 
It remains to be seen, however, how GameStopâs entry into the secondary card marketplace will impact independent retailers. Many local game shops do a steady business in so-called âsinglesâ and graded cards, and it continues to be a strong source of revenue in an otherwise turbulent retail landscape.

Bungieâs classic Marathon games are coming to Steam for free,"The original Marathon games from Bungie are coming to Steam, and will be available to download for free, the developer behind Destiny 2 announced Friday. The first game in the first-person shooter franchise is available now in the form of Classic Marathon. Sequels Classic Marathon 2 and Classic Marathon Infinity are listed as âcoming soonâ on Steam.
Bungie credits the Aleph One community of open-source developers with bringing the classic Marathon trilogy to Steam. Aleph One supports the original Marathon, Marathon 2: Durandal, and Marathon Infinity as part of the open source project, which is available to download through its official website.
The Steam versions of the classic Marathon trilogy will support both Mac and Windows PC. Its open-source authors promise âauthentic gameplayâ with modern conveniences: optional widescreen HUD support, 3D filtering/perspective, positional audio, and 60 fps interpolation.
Bungie has a new take on Marathon in the works for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The new Marathon will be a player-versus-player, team-based extraction shooter in which squads of cybernetic Runners compete to retrieve artifacts, implants, and weapons from a hostile environment. After revealing the game a year ago, Bungie said it planned to go dark âfor an extended periodâ until such time as itâs ready to show actual gameplay from the new Marathon.
For now, you can catch up on the original trilogy at no cost. No doubt Bungie will stuff the new Marathon with references to the old ones, should you want to brush up on your lore.",https://www.polygon.com/24153828/bungie-marathon-classic-trilogy-games-steam-free,2024-05-10 20:01:47
"Warner Bros. reverses course, wonât delist Adult Swim indie games, devs say","Warner Bros. Discovery appears to have backed down from its plans to delist more than a dozen games published by its Adult Swim Games label from Steam and digital console stores. WBD now plans to transfer ownership of some of those games back to the indie devs that made them, according to developers who would have been affected by the planned delistings.
Plans to delist the Adult Swim Games catalog from digital stores â or âretireâ them, as Warner Bros. Discovery had worded it â became public in March and were widely criticized as a cold corporate move that could make some indie games unavailable to purchase. That strong criticism appears to have played a part in WBDâs revised plan to transfer ownership of the games back to their creators.
News of WBDâs policy reversal was first revealed by developer Owen Deery, who is behind puzzle-adventure game Small Radios Big Televisions, which was originally published by Adult Swim Games in 2016. (Deery also broke the news of WBDâs original plan to âretireâ Adult Swim titles back in March.) On the social media platform X, Deery wrote that Small Radios Big Televisions âwill not be âretiredâ,â despite previous communication from WBD that it would be. âOwnership and store listings will return to me,â Deery said.
Developer Landon Podbielski said that his multiplayer platform shooter Duck Game, another Adult Swim Games-published release threatened with delisting, will also be reverted to its creator. âThe game is being returned to Corptron along with its store pages on all platforms,â Podbielski said on X. âItâs not going anywhere.â
Other developers whose games were published by Adult Swim Games confirmed to Polygon that theyâve received similar communication from Warner Bros. Discovery, and will have their titles transferred back to them rather than be delisted. WBD told developers it âheard the feedback and concerns regarding the retirement of titles published under Adult Swim Games,â one developer said in an email to Polygon.
But other developers who had their work published by Adult Swim Games say theyâre still waiting to hear from Warner Bros. Discovery. Two developers Polygon spoke to say they never received the original messaging from WBD back in March, and still havenât heard from the company, despite multiple attempts to contact representatives there. Polygon has reached out to Warner Bros. Discovery for comment and will update when the company responds.
The media conglomerateâs planned removal of Adult Swim Games titles echoed similar cuts from its film and television business; Warner Bros. Discovery infamously scrapped plans to release nearly complete movies Batgirl and Coyote vs. Acme, and removed multiple series from its Max streaming services. Warner Bros. has since licensed some of its scrapped television content to other streamers; animated series Batman: Caped Crusader, for example, will stream on Amazonâs Prime Video platform this summer.

Hereâs one yellow-box game delay statement that everyone seems to like,"In a week (month? year?) when lots of people are feeling pretty sour over the way some game companies choose to explain their decisions to their audience, hereâs a rarity â a game delay statement that shows such humility, honesty, and passion for the medium that itâs gone over extremely well.
The statement comes from Evil Empire, the Dead Cells developer now making a roguelike Prince of Persia game for Ubisoft â and the reason for the delay, as Evil Empire humbly admits, is the surprise early access release of Hades 2, the hotly anticipated sequel to a roguelike classic, on May 6.
Rogue Prince of Persia had been set for release on May 14 (also in early access, on PC). In a subsequent statement, Evil Empire said the game would be released on May 27, adding: âBut if [Hollow Knight] Silksong shadow-drops in the next two weeks weâre burning the whole thing down!â
Itâs a smart decision, but whatâs really striking is the generosity and candor with which Evil Empire has framed its decision â as well as its cheeky use of the yellow-box format (much-memed during Cyberpunk 2077âs tortuous journey to release, and beyond).
So we've got a little bit of news about The Rogue Prince of Persia, it's all in the big yellow box https://t.co/S3FiyGFfrY pic.twitter.com/9PXlw4J2MZ
âSeeing as everyone and their mum is playing [Hades 2] (including our entire team... and their mums), we have decided to let people have their fun with it before we release The Rogue Prince of Persia,â Evil Empire posted. 
âWhile we have every confidence in The Rogue Prince of Persia, itâs not every day that a game in the same genre as you, which is one of the most anticipated upcoming games of 2024, will release into Early Access a week before you plan to do the same. We are not prideful enough to ignore the implications of that, and we truly believe that this short delay is the best decision for us and our Early Access journey.
âThis also lets us keep polishing up the game, add even more cool things and kick some stubborn bugs out before release. The Day 1 patch was getting pretty hefty, so gaining more time to test it and add more stuff before launch day has considerably lowered the stress levels of our producer and game director already!
âWe completely understand that this is annoying news to hear for everyone who was eager to play the game, especially so close to the anticipated release. We can only hold our hands up, apologise and hope that you understand. It will be worth the wait! Thank you for your patience.â
Isnât that nice? Evil Empire gave a fellow developer their props, showed enthusiasm for a rival game, modestly understood their role in the pecking order, apologized â and most importantly, were completely open with fans about the reasons for it. Creditâs due to publisher Ubisoft, too, which presumably greenlit the decision and this way of communicating it.
Rare is the delay announcement that earns goodwill rather than erodes it, but this is a fantastic example of one.
Update [May 13]: This article has been updated to include the new release date for Rogue Prince of Persia, May 27, which Evil Empire announced on X.
The Rogue Prince of Persia's new release date is 27th May! If you didn't see our previous post, the TLDR is to give people time to play Hades 2, including us But if Silksong shadow-drops in the next two weeks we're burning the whole thing down!Anyway, we can also reveal Theâ¦ pic.twitter.com/ZQM3l5DcBI",https://www.polygon.com/24153672/rogue-prince-of-persia-hades-2-release-date-delay,2024-05-10 17:00:49

The next season of Critical Roleâs The Legend of Vox Machina drops this fall,"Buried in the announcement of the launch of Critical Roleâs new subscription service, Beacon, is more good news for fans. The third season of the troupeâs Prime Video animated series, The Legend of Vox Machina, is due out this fall. The release window was confirmed on X by Critical Role CEO Travis Willingham. A release date has not been revealed.
Vox Machina refers to the adventuring party featured in Critical Roleâs first Dungeons & Dragons actual-play series, which concluded in 2017 after producing hundreds of hours of streaming content shared through Geek & Sundry, Twitch, and YouTube. Its main characters include Grog Strongjaw, Pike Trickfoot, Percival de Rolo, Scanlan Shorthalt, Keyleth, Vaxâildan, and Vexâahlia, among others. The first season of the Amazon-produced animated series aired beginning in Jan. 2022, with the second season arriving in Jan. 2023.

Critical Role is also working with Prime Video to adapt its second D&D campaign, named for its adventuring party, The Mighty Nein. That series concluded in June 2021 with some 560 hours of streaming content and features characters such as Caleb Widogast, Veth âNott the Braveâ Brenatto, Jester Lavorre, Fjord, Beauregard Lionett, Mollymauk Tealeaf, and Yasha Nydoorin, among others. Announced in Jan. 2023, the partnership with Amazon also includes a potential for a major motion picture.

"Red, White, and Royal Blue sequel in the works at Prime Video","A sequel to Red, White & Royal Blue is in the works from Prime Video. Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez are both reprising their roles as Prince Henry and Alex Claremont-Diaz, Matthew LÃ³pez, director and writer of the first film, returns to write the script. And for anyone whoâs worried that the sequel movie might not capture the bookâs spirit, donât worry â author Casey McQuiston will also be co-writing the script.
Based on the immensely popular romance novel of the same name, Red, White & Royal Blue follows a fictional prince of England and U.S. presidentâs son who fall in love after some wonderful rivals-to-friends-to-hook-up-buddies tension. The movie adaptation changes a few details, but otherwise is a pretty faithful recreation of the story which charmed many hardcore fans of the book. 
Thereâs no release date or plot details for the sequel, but if youâre itching for a rom-com in the mean time, Prime Videoâs latest one, The Idea of You, also stars Galitzine (this time alongside Anne Hathaway). And if youâre hungry for more queer rom-coms specifically, McQuistonâs newest book, The Pairing, is out on Aug. 6.

"Critical Role launches its own subscription service, Beacon","The Critical Role actual play empire is expanding again. On Thursday, the group of Dungeons & Dragons-playing voice actors announced Beacon, a new membership program that promises to be âthe most direct wayâ to support Critical Role. Beacon will offer âa wide range of exclusive and early access programmingâ among its member perks and, crucially, let Critical Role bypass third-party video services like YouTube and Twitch, where much of its content is streamed and hosted.
But Critical Role isnât abandoning those platforms, its creators say. âNothing changes for audiences on Twitch and YouTube,â Critical Role CEO and cast member Travis Willingham said in a video announcing Beacon. But the new members-only Beacon promises âa more unfiltered experienceâ for fans of Critical Role, Willingham said.
Beacon will cost $5.99 monthly, or $59.99 annually. Critical Role is currently offering a free, limited, seven-day trial.
In addition to early access programming and exclusive videos, Beacon promises live event pre-sales (which would hopefully help members avoid sold-out shows, scalpers, and surge pricing), instant access to videos on demand and podcasts, access to an exclusive Discord server, and discounts on merchandise.
Beacon will boast two exclusive series: Critical Role Fireside Chat, described as a monthly Ask Me Anything series where cast members answer questions from Discord; and Critical Role Cooldown, a âbackstage passâ that promises to let viewers experience the castâs post-show reactions. Beacon subscribers will also get early access to series Critical Role Abridged, a condensed highlight reel-style show, alongside all-ages actual play audio series Re-Slayerâs Take and day-and-date audio versions of the mainline Critical Role broadcasts.
Marisha Ray, cast member and creative director at Critical Role, said Beacon lets the troupe âbring more of our business in-house.â Less reliance on third-party platform providers seems to be a big part of Critical Roleâs plan. âItâs no secret that video platforms have [...] been through their ups and downs,â Ray said, adding, âitâs not uncommon for our content to get demonetized because we all have the vocabulary of teenage sailors.â Ray also acknowledged platforms like YouTube and Twitch running ads on Critical Role content âthat donât really vibe with our beliefs.â
Willingham mentioned another third-party platform: Patreon. He said Beacon will offer fans âa more direct lineâ to Critical Roleâs content, cast, and community.
âWeâre incredibly excited about what Beacon opens up for us, and how we engage with our audience,â Willingham said in a statement. âNothing changes with how folks can watch our current slate of shows and weâre stoked to offer access, content and perks in ways that we never have before.â
Critical Role launched nine years ago as a web series where professional voice actors (Laura Bailey, Taliesin Jaffe, Ashley Johnson, Matthew Mercer, Liam OâBrien, Marisha Ray, Sam Riegel, and Travis Willingham) improvise their way through D&D campaigns. Over the course of hundreds of episodes spanning multiple campaigns, Critical Role has evolved and expanded to include comic books, animated series, their own tabletop role-playing game systems, and other video spinoff series. The seriesâ creators say that Beacon will let them continue to invest in their franchises and business.",https://www.polygon.com/24152976/critical-role-beacon-subscription-membership,2024-05-09 19:49:56

And of course, no PokÃ©mon-inspired set would be complete without a PokÃ© Ball. In this case, itâs a berry-flavored lip mask ($12) in the shape of a PokÃ© Ball shapred jar.
If youâre having a hard time choosing what to get, the full PokÃ©mon ColourPop collection is available for $159.
The PokÃ©mon collection is live now, and will hit Ulta stores on May 12.

Peter Jacksonâs âHunt for Gollumâ movie is likely a hidden Aragorn epic,"The news is out: Peter Jackson and his Lord of the Rings collaborators will executive-produce a new movie set in Middle-earth, with Andy Serkis reprising his role as Gollum and directing, and the working title is Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum. 
So thereâs just one question: What, exactly, could it be about? With real experts on the text like Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson, and Fran Walsh involved, thereâs one thing that leaps to mind immediately â a 50-day slog during which Aragorn captured Gollum in a marsh and dragged him bodily overland for close to 900 miles until they reached the court prisons of the elven king Thranduil.
So actually, there are two questions: What is The Hunt for Gollum about? and How do you make that into a great movie? 
Most of what we know about this period in Aragornâs and Gollumâs lives comes from the text of The Fellowship of the Ring, in some asides during the Council of Elrond about Gandalfâs long quest to verify whether Bilboâs ring was indeed the fabled One Ring. 
Jacksonâs movie shortens this period for brevityâs sake, but in J.R.R. Tolkienâs text, 17 years elapse between Bilboâs 111th birthday, when Frodo gets the Ring, and the scene when Gandalf returns to see if Frodo has kept it secret (kept it safe). Gandalf spent a lot of that time looking for Gollum, so that he could question the creature about how he got the Ring. To that end, he recruited Aragorn for his skills as a tracker. 
But finding Gollum in all of Middle-earth turned out to be a real needle-in-a-haystack kind of thing, and eventually they decided to give up. Gandalf went to Gondor, to read ancient texts, and Aragorn headed west, back to his rangers. Thatâs when, by complete chance, Aragorn found Gollumâs tracks in the Dead Marshes and caught him. 
Then it took Aragorn over a month and a half to drag his prisoner to civilization so that Gandalf could interrogate him. You know that scene where Sam and Frodo are dragging Gollum along while he screams like hellâs own toddler? Imagine that, but for seven weeks. Tolkien makes it extraordinarily â maybe hilariously â clear that this was not fun. 
âHe was covered with green slime,â Aragorn tells the Council. âHe will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and I was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks of his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back, watching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter on his neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever towards Mirkwood. I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for we had agreed that this should be done; and I was glad to be rid of his company, for he stank.â 
You heard it â from the mouth of Aragorn II, King Elessar Telcontar, Chieftain of the DÃºnedain of the North, Isildurâs Heir, Elendilâs Heir, High King of Gondor and Arnor, King of the West: 
Gollum... âhe stank.â 
This interlude is really the only thing in the Lord of the Rings that matches up with a âhuntâ for Gollum. Nobody else really hunts for him! Sure, he was tortured by Sauron, but only after he freely wandered into Mordor. He did eventually escape from Mirkwoodâs prisons, but elves lost his trail pretty immediately. 
If weâre really talking about Aragornâs terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month here... Are Viggo Mortensen and Ian McKellen coming back to play Aragorn and Gandalf? What about Lee Pace and Orlando Bloom as Mirkwoodâs King Thranduil and Legolas, respectively? Tolkien fans put together a well-regarded unofficial The Hunt for Gollum film in 2009, but at a mere 38 minutes long. How on Middle-earth does this single-paragraph saga get built out into a feature-length blockbuster? 
If it were anyone else than Boyens, Jackson, Walsh, and Serkis, it would be easy to dismiss the whole idea to begin with. But the group has got at least a 50% gold track record on producing Lord of the Rings movies â maybe they can make the worldâs worst buddy road trip movie work.

Surprise! Batman: Caped Crusader is alive and well and premieres this summer,"Much like the weird creature of the night it is named after, Batman: Caped Crusader has been shrouded in mystery since it was announced, with only a neat teaser poster to go on that was evocative of radio serials and a noir-ish feel. Executive-produced by the powerhouse trio of J.J. Abrams, The Batman director Matt Reeves, and Batman: The Animated Series co-creator Bruce Timm, Caped Crusader stands to be the splashiest animated take on Batman in some time. The best part is, we wonât have to wait very long for it: Prime Video announced Thursday that Caped Crusader will premiere on Aug. 1.
Included in the news is a rundown of Caped Crusaderâs cast of characters, which Iâm reproducing here because there are a lot of clues within about the sort of tone and stories the series is going for: extremely old-school noir with a modern edge, with visual inspiration ripped right from Detective Comics #27. It seems like the sort of thing Timm was going for the first time with Batman: The Animated Series, just with fewer concessions to being a childrenâs program. 
BATMAN - A cold, remorseless avenger of evil, seemingly more machine than man. Forged in the fire of tragedy, every fiber of his being is dedicated to the eradication of crime.
BRUCE WAYNE - To the public at large, Bruce Wayne is a shallow dilettante, apparently wasting his parentsâ vast fortune on frivolous pursuits and hedonistic pleasures. In fact, heâs an elaborate facade, carefully constructed to divert attention from his activities as Batman.
SELINA KYLE / âCATWOMANâ - Selena Kyle is a blithe and pampered heiress whose family lost their fortune after her father was imprisoned for embezzlement. Despite having the silver spoon yanked from her mouth, Selina refuses to quit living in the lap of luxury and becomes Catwoman as a âfunâ way to maintain her lavish lifestyle.
DR. HARLEEN QUINZEL / âHARLEY QUINNâ - Despite a personable and bubbly demeanor, Dr. Harleen Quinzel is a brilliant psychiatrist who treats some of Gothamâs elite. However, as Harley Quinn, she is a different person, entirely. A creepy, quiet, calculating menace who secretly dispenses her twisted justice to the truly despicable among her elite clientele.
COMMISSIONER JIM GORDON - Former beat cop close to retirement, Gordon was hired to play along with the corrupt system and run out the clock till he can draw a pension. But theyâve sorely underestimated Jim Gordon. His unassailable character brings him into conflict with dirty cops and crooked politicians, alike. Not to mention, he has to reckon with a deranged vigilante beating up Gothamâs criminals.
CLAYFACE - Thanks to his âuniqueâ facial features, screen actor Basil Karlo has been forever typecast as a B-movie heavy. Frustrated by the limitations his appearance put on both his career and personal life (he fell hopelessly in love with his co-star), Karlo turned to an experimental serum that promised to change his face. However, not only does this serum ultimately disfigure his face, but it ruptures the last of his sanity â creating the tragic, vengeance seeking villain, Clayface.
First announced in 2021, Caped Crusader was pitched as âthrilling, cinematic and evocative of Batmanâs noir rootsâ in the early days of HBO Max, before the service was rebranded as Max and waves of extremely questionable cost cutting left the show in limbo. In March 2023, the series was saved from cancellation by Amazon Prime Video, with at least two seasons in the works. 
Batman: Caped Crusaderâs 10-episode first season will debut Aug. 1 on Prime Video. Check out the preview images below. ",https://www.polygon.com/24152823/batman-caped-crusader-prime-video-release-date,2024-05-09 16:00:00

"We will finally gets a Gollum movie in 2026, precious, we will","Last year, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that the company would be producing new Lord of the Rings movies, but said very little about what they would be about â riddles in the dark, if you will. Itâs been a long 15 months since then, but the latest Middle-earth adventure has finally been revealed: Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, directed by and starring Andy Serkis. 
âA Gollum movie?â you might say. âHow derivative! Wasnât there just a video game about this?â 
Indeed there was, constant reader. However, the film might differ in the very crucial manner of being a pleasurable experience. 

    Related
  
According to Variety, the film is still early in development, with a script being worked on by Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou alongside Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens â who, along with Peter Jackson, have signed on as co-producers that WBD CEO David Zaslav says will be involved âevery step of the way.â 
Even though the story is actively being worked on â the title also isnât final â we can safely surmise that it is a prequel, as Gollum, famously, is super dead by the end of The Return of the King. Book readers might take this premise to suggest the story is set in the nebulous and quite long period between Bilboâs Party at the start of The Fellowship of the Ring, and the beginning of the quest to destroy the Ring, when Gandalf sent Aragorn to find Gollum. 
That said, there is probably a reason why both book and films never really bothered to recount this particular side quest in detail: It doesnât seem to be about anything in particular. And as the first of a planned âbatchâ of new Rings movies, it doesnât exactly inspire confidence, no matter how badly I may want to see Andy Serkis in a movie again.",https://www.polygon.com/24152753/lord-of-the-rings-gollum-movie-2026-andy-serkis,2024-05-09 14:45:00
"SimCity, Resident Evil among five 2024 Video Game Hall of Fame inductees","The Strong National Museum of Play has announced the five games joining the World Video Game Hall of Fame this year: Asteroids, Myst, Resident Evil, Ultima, and SimCity. These five games beat out other classics, like Neopets, Metroid, and Tony Hawkâs Pro Skater, to grab a place in the World Video Game Hall of Fameâs 10th class.
Last year, Barbie Fashion Designer, Computer Space, The Last of Us, and Wii Sports made it into the World Video Game Hall of Fame. The 2024 class of inductees will join these titles as part of the Strong Museumâs World Video Game Hall of Fame rotunda, which is part of the ESL Digital Worlds exhibit. A group called the International Selection Advisory Committee, which the Strong Museum said is made up of âjournalists and scholars familiar with the history of video games and their roles in society,â votes on the games to be inducted. The public had also been voting, and the top three games voted in by the public were added to a single ballot.
These five games have influenced different parts of the video game industry, with Asteroids making its mark as Atariâs best-selling coin-operated arcade game; Myst in showcasing its iconic, imaginative world; SimCity by defining the city-building simulation genre; Ultima setting the tone for fantasy role-playing games; and Resident Evil putting survival horror on the map. Hereâs how the Strong Museum described the games and their impact on the industry:
About Asteroids: Released in 1979, Atariâs Asteroids offered players challenging gameplay, glowing graphics, and intense sound effects in an action-packed space setting. The game quickly supplanted the popular Space Invaders in many arcades and sold more than 70,000 arcade units, becoming Atariâs bestselling coin-operated game. The home version of the gameâmade available on the Atari 2600âtook the gameâs popularity to new heights, bringing it into millions of living rooms.
Says Jeremy Saucier, assistant vice president for interpretation and electronic games, âThrough endless variants and remakes across dozens of arcade, home, handheld, and mobile platforms, Asteroids made a simple, yet challenging game about blasting rocks into one of the most widely played and influential video games of all time.â
About Myst: Released by Broderbund in 1993, Myst welcomed players to a mesmerizing world of mysterious puzzles and haunting vistas. The game harnessed early CD-ROM technologyâwhich offered high storage capacity but slow loading times. The discs paired well with the slow-paced, contemplative style of the game, though, and allowed for a level of player immersion never before experienced in computer games. Myst became the best-selling computer game in the 1990s, selling more than six million copies.
Says Kristy Hisert, collections manager, âFew other games can match Mystâs ability to open imaginative worlds. It was a work of artistic genius that captured the imagination of an entire generation of computer game players, and its influence can be seen in many of todayâs open-world games.â
About Resident Evil: Although it wasnât the first horror video game, Resident Evil (or Biohazard as it was known in Japan) was the first game to popularize the âsurvival horrorâ genre. Created by game director Shinji Mikami and released by Capcom in 1996, Resident Evil spawned a billion-dollar media franchise while it helped demonstrate that video games could offer mature entertainment for older teenagers and adults. As of 2022, films based on the Resident Evil franchise have collective grossed more than $1.2 billion. 
Says Lindsey Kurano, video game curator, âResident Evilâs combination of cheesy B-movie dialogue, engrossing gameplay, and chilling suspense made it a favorite of gamers searching for more mature video games, and it helped establish one of gamingâs most enduring franchises.â
About SimCity: Released by Maxis in 1989, SimCity helped expand the audience for video games by offering a city building simulator that appealed to adults as much as children. Drawing from real-life principles of urban design, it allowed players to build their own city and respond to ever-changing problems. The game generated numerous sequels and offshoots â such as 2016 World Video Game Hall of Fame inductee The Sims â and influenced the development of many city-building simulation games and even real-time strategy games, like Command & Conquer and Age of Empires. 
Says Aryol Prater, research specialist for Black play and culture, âSimulations are some of the oldest forms of video games, but few have had the popularity, influence, or staying power of SimCity. At a time when many people thought of video games in terms of arcade shooters or console platformers, SimCity appealed to players who wanted intellectually stimulating fun on their newly bought personal computers.â
About Ultima: Ultima: The First Age of Darkness helped define the computer role-playing genre. Designed by Richard Garriott and released in 1981, Ultima combined role-playing mechanics, a massive fictional world, and fantasy and science fiction themes. Ultimaâs innovative gameplay laid the foundation for one of the most enduring and influential gaming franchises of all time (with eight sequels). Many top game designers credit it with inspiring their later role-playing games, such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.  
Says Andrew Borman, director of digital preservation, âUltima helped define the computer role-playing game genre. Although it may not be a household name, the game, and the series it spawned, are legendary among role-playing game fans and game developers around the world.â",https://www.polygon.com/24150542/simcity-asteroids-resident-evil-video-game-hall-of-fame-2024,2024-05-09 14:30:00
These new bean bag chairs push the limits of PokÃ©mon roundness ,"PokÃ©mon Center has become a leading purveyor of all things round, squishy, and big. First we got the comically large life-sized Spheal. Now the online seller of PokÃ©mon merchandise has released another banger: PokÃ©mon bean bag chairs. As of Wednesday, fans can pre-order from the PokÃ©mon x Yogibo line. Interested buyers have the options to purchase round, plump bean bag versions of Lechonk, Gengar, and Jigglypuff. 
Yogibo has an established reputation for making comfortable (and fancy) bean bags. Its website touts bean bag innovations like a âpatented combination of the inner and outer coversâ that allows the bags to mold to your body. These special sacks a heavy price tag, though: All three versions of the bean bag â Lechonk, Gengar, and Jigglypuff â retail for $299.99. So youâll have to pony up if you want a Lechonk that will cradle your body. 
Each bean bag measures 30 x 30 x 30 inches and weighs about 12 pounds. Thatâs enough to hold a butt, but you it might not make for a full-body lounge for a grown adult. Still, the overall look of these chairs got me giggling. For starters, I donât think Iâve ever seen such a round version of Gengar. Sure, heâs always had a plump physique for a ghost-type, but now heâs going full-on basketball. I also just love the little nub feet at the bottom. You can view front and side-angle images of it below, just to get an idea of how round this bad boy is. 
The Jigglypuff is a great color, and would make an incredible addition to any person who wants more pink decor in their life. However, I still canât get over the completely empty look in its eyes. Itâs just a bit deflated. It seems like Jigglypuff is internally screaming for help in its new life as a seat for humans. 
Personally, I think the winner of the three is Lechonk. This porker and its eye-to-eye smile appears ready and happy to be your seating of choice. The best part is, it somehow looks cute even when itâs being squished. 
If any of these three options seem up your alley, you can pre-order them on the PokÃ©mon Center site now. ",https://www.polygon.com/deals/24152211/pokemon-center-bean-bags-shop-order-lechonk-gengar-jigglypuff,2024-05-08 20:23:54
George Miller explains what his live-action Furiosa kept from the anime version,"For more than a decade, reports have been circulating about the original version of the upcoming action movie Furiosa â an anime series that director George Miller and writer Mahiro Maeda were working on at the same time they were developing Mad Max: Fury Road. At a Q&A after a recent press screening for Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga at IMAX Headquarters outside of Los Angeles, Miller revealed that while the anime series eventually evolved into a live-action film, one small element survived from the defunct project, taken from early character sketches by Fury Road concept artist and anime stalwart Maeda. 
Miller revealed that the script for Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga was finished before he even filmed Fury Road. âIn order to tell that story cohesively, we had to know everything that happened in the time before [the movie started],â he said. âSo we wrote a story about Furiosa from the time she was taken as a child, as she refers to in Fury Road, until she became the Imperator Furiosa. That ended up as a full screenplay, with concept art and so on. And the actors, the designers, and all the crew got the screenplay of that before shooting Fury Road.â
That unusual production route led to the supplementary screenplay being considered as an anime project, with Fury Road concept artist Maeda â best known for his work on Evangelion 3.0 and Kill Bill â creating designs for the series. His art has been shared online since 2015, when the film version of Furiosa was believed to be just as dead as the anime project. âWe were thinking of making it as an anime, and thatâs part of why it was so well-developed,â Miller said. âBut then Fury Road was delayed, so there was no point in making an anime.â 
The only element taken from that concept art that actually made it into the final Furiosa film: an unexpected accessory worn by Chris Hemsworthâs villainous wasteland warlord, Dementus. The imposing figure wears a teddy bear chained to his body, and places it on his vehicle dashboard as he rides around in his war motorcade. After being exposed to the elements of the Wasteland, itâs a pretty beat-up bear, but itâs a key part of his look. We wonât get into the teddy bearâs origin â thatâs best experienced by watching Furiosa â but we can say its positioning highlights its importance. 
âThat teddy bear â [Maeda] started doing some illustrations and put that bear in,â Miller said at the post-screening Q&A. âAnd then that became a part of the story. So that was already there before Fury Road.â 
Juxtaposing the cuteness of the golden plush toy with Dementusâ chains-and-oiled-muscles dynamic feels very much like the kind of cartoony, comedic element an anime series would bring to these characters. It brings an unexpectedly cute element to the brutality of Furiosaâs war-torn landscape. The filmâs aesthetic sensibilities also lean heavily into anime influences, from the charactersâ dramatic action poses on the posters to the hyper-stylized desert-steampunk costuming. 
The teddy bear isnât just a stylistic flourish, either. Itâs deeply connected to Dementus â and ultimately, to his relationship with Furiosa and the 18-year narrative the Furiosa movie lays out. Itâll all be clearer when you see how Hemsworthâs rough-and-ready teddy plays into the filmâs post-apocalyptic action epic, when Furiosa hits theaters on May 24.

"Sega announces Sonic Rumble, a mobile Fall Guys-style party game","Sega has been playing a little fast and loose with Sonic the Hedgehog lately, using the blue blur for experimental projects like The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog. At the same time, the movies based on the franchise have been surprisingly good. Hereâs another treat for the Sonic enjoyers out there: Sega just announced Sonic Rumble, a 32-player PvP mobile game created with Finnish studio Rovio.
Sonic Rumble immediately invites comparisons to other party games, like those in the Mario Party franchise, or Fall Guys. It looks like Sonic Rumbleâs minigames are a little less infuriating than Fall Guysâ chaotic bean struggles, with some rounds focusing on traditional platforming levels. Others, however, look a lot more brutal â at one point, a giant chomping robot inexorably approaches, knocking out contenders left and right. 
Out of the 32 players, there can only be one winner. Players can also collect rings, which allows them to unlock new cosmetics like a pirate costume for Shadow the Hedgehog. The lore is that Sonic Rumble is a Jumanji-style world created by Dr. Eggman, and heâs managed to bring the whole cast into it. Itâs always fun to see new appearances of side Sonic characters, like my beloved Big the Cat.
Sega will be hosting a closed beta test from May 24 through May 26; players can apply to test the game out on its official site. We expect the game to release for everyone this winter. ",https://www.polygon.com/24152123/sega-sonic-rumble-party-game-beta-testing,2024-05-08 17:35:28
"Microsoft closing Redfall, Hi-Fi Rush studios among other cuts","Microsoft is closing three Bethesda studios: Redfall developer Arkane Austin, Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Studios, and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks. A fourth developer, support studio Roundhouse Games, will have all staff reassigned to a new team. Xbox Game Studios leader Matt Booty announced the news to staff in an email Tuesday citing a reprioritization of âhigh-impact titles,â according to IGN. Arkane, Alpha Dog, and Tango Gameworks confirmed the closures on their respective X accounts.
âToday it was announced that Arkane Austin will close and development will not continue on Redfall,â Arkane said in its X post. Arkane Lyon continues development on its own projects, it said. Redfall players who purchased upgrades and were still waiting on DLC will not receive them, Arkane said, pointing those impacted to a Bethesda website where players can eventually apply for credit. Microsoft has not published details yet on how to receive that credit. Bootyâs letter to staff said that âsomeâ Arkane staff will join other Bethesda projects.
Microsoft has not responded to Polygonâs request for comment.

Mighty Doom, a top-down shooter based on the Doom franchise, will go offline on Aug. 7 after the studio closure. Players are no longer able to make purchases in that game, according to the studioâs X post. People who spent real money for in-game currency can also apply for a refund. Tango Gameworks will also close, while Roundhouse Games will merge with ZeniMax Online Studios to work on The Elder Scrolls Online.
Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, and Tango Gameworks each released a game in 2023: Redfall, Mighty Doom, and Hi-Fi Rush, respectively. Hi-Fi Rush was the most successful of all of them after it was surprise-released early in the year. The action rhythm game was a far cry from Tango Gameworksâ The Evil Within and The Evil Within 2, for which the studio had previously been known. The studio also released Ghostwire: Tokyo and Hero Dice in 2022. 
Meanwhile, Redfall from Arkane Austin didnât live up to expectations â even Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer called its release âdisappointing,â but said the team was still committed to fixing its problems. Both Arkane and Tango Gameworks have been part of ZeniMax for more than a decade.
This is absolutely terrible. Permission to be human : to any executive reading this, friendly reminder that video games are an entertainment/cultural industry, and your business as a corporation is to take care of your artists/entertainers and help them create value for you.
Responding to the closures, Arkane Lyon co-creative director Dinga Bakaba called the cuts âabsolutely terribleâ in a thread on X. âPermission to be human : to any executive reading this, friendly reminder that video games are an entertainment/cultural industry, and your business as a corporation is to take care of your artists/entertainers and help them create value for you,â he wrote. âDonât throw us into gold fever gambits, donât use us as strawmen for miscalculations/blind spots, donât make our work environments darwinist jungles. You say we make you proud when we make a good game. Make us proud when times are tough. We know you can, we seen it before.â
Alpha Dog is perhaps the lesser known of the three dismantled studios; it had previously worked on mobile games. The studio was acquired by ZeniMax Media in 2019 and brought under Microsoft in 2021 during the $7.5 billion ZeniMax acquisition. Roundhouse, which will merge with ZeniMax Online, was previously known as Human Head Studios but closed after publishing Rune 2 in 2019; it was reborn as Roundhouse Studios under Bethesda shortly after.
Itâs unclear exactly how many people are impacted by the studio closures. The news comes just months after Microsoft announced it was laying off 1,900 people, or 8% of its workforce, following its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. More than 10,000 people were laid off across the video game industry last year; that number has been nearly matched just five months into 2024. While 2023 may have been defined by layoffs, 2024 seems to be fraught with studio closures. Just one week into May and at least six studios have closed now, with these three (and a fourth closed in name) Bethesda studios joining Take-Two Softwareâs Roll7 and Intercept Games.
Update: This story has been updated to clarify that Microsoft is closing three studios and reassigning all staff of a fourth to a new team.",https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall,2024-05-07 14:22:10
Nintendo finally admits itâs making the Switch 2,"Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa officially acknowledged Nintendo is making a Switch successor â called Switch 2 by many, albeit not by Nintendo â in a message coinciding with the companyâs yearly financial results. Yes, we all knew the Nintendo Switch successor was coming, but Nintendo had said nothing about the console ahead of Furukawaâs message.
âThis is Furukawa, President of Nintendo,â Furukawa said in the message posted to X. âWe will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.â
This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Directâ¦
Nintendoâs fiscal year ended in late March, so the timeline for a Switch 2 announcement would be within a year from that time â before March 31, 2025. Nintendo confirmed via Furukawaâs announcement that a Nintendo Direct is scheduled for June, but that the company wonât talk about the new console there; that event will be squarely focused on Nintendo Switch games expected out in the second half of 2024.
Though Nintendoâs said very little about the console, news has been steadily leaking about it for the past few months. The latest news is that the Switchâs Joy-Con controllers will attach with magnets instead of the original consoleâs sliding rails. According to a few reports, the Joy-Cons will be larger and feature more buttons, while the Switch 2 will have an 8-inch screen. The console is expected to be backward compatible with Nintendo Switch games and peripherals.

First photo confirms: James Gunnâs Superman will wear his underwear on the outside,"With only 14 months left before the inaugural film of Warner Bros.â reimagined DC Comics film slate, director James Gunn shared a first look at at his Superman movie in the traditional way, by showing off a new take on the heroâs costume. But thatâs not the only traditional thing about it. 
Actor David Corenswet appears in a dusty version of the classic red and blue look, with an angular, seemingly Kingdom Come-inspired chest emblem, and its own set of modern texture lines. But if examined closely (ignore that glowing ball of energy outside, itâs probably fine) the photo also boasts a throwback detail not seen on a big screen Superman since before 2013âs Man of Steel: Red trunks. 
A post shared by James Gunn (@jamesgunn)
When Superman set the standard that all future superhero costumes would definitionally reflect, it was in the imitation of athletic stage costumes of the 1930s: Brightly colored, form fitting, and with a set of trunks for modesty. But Superman spent most of the 2010s trunkless after a 2011 costume redesign; his costume just a textured blue sheath from neck to boot, broken only by a mostly ornamental red belt. 
Itâs that form that inspired the Superman costume of the Snyderverse. But just as DC Comics returned to the traditional red trunks for the one thousandth issue of Action Comics in 2018 to honor Supermanâs enduring presence, it appears that Superman (previously known as Superman: Legacy) is looking to evoke an earlier age, or a broader consideration of Supermanâs vibe. 
That ball of purple and green energy (classic Lex Luthor colors) is certainly mysterious, but the clearest hint this picture has of what audiences will find in 2025âs Superman is sitting right in the seat of that chair. The textured lines and the angular S say modernity, even futurism, but the trunks? The trunks say tradition. 
And James Gunn is steeped in enough comics and comics criticism to know it.

Gen V producers wonât recast the late Chance Perdomoâs character ,"Gen Vâs second season is changing significantly after the tragic death of star Chance Perdomo. 
In a statement on Sunday, the showâs producers announced that they will not be recasting Perdomoâs character, Andre Anderson. Instead, the team has been reworking season 2 ahead of production.
âAs we continue to navigate the tragic loss of Chance Perdomo, everyone at Gen V is determined to find the best way to pay respect to his memory,â the statement says. âWe wonât be recasting the role, because one one can replace Chance. Instead, we have been taking the time and space to recraft our Season 2 storylines as we begin production in May. We will honor Chance and his legacy this season.â 
While we donât know how much of a change this means for the writersâ original plans, Andre was one of the main characters of Gen Vâs first season, and seemed set for an even bigger role in season 2. Itâs also unclear whether Perdomoâs character was planned to have any crossover with The Boys, whose fourth season will premiere in June. Perdomo died in a motorcycle crash in March on the way to Toronto to begin filming for Gen Vâs second season.
Gen V season 2 doesnât have a release date yet, but with production starting in the next few weeks, we likely wonât see the show return until 2025.",https://www.polygon.com/24150137/gen-v-chance-perdomo-recast-character,2024-05-06 15:59:53
Magic: The Gathering Black Lotus sells for record-breaking $3 million ,"There are a few constants in this chaotic life: death, taxes, and Magic The Gatheringâs Black Lotus card selling for increasingly absurd sums of money.
An Alpha Black Lotus card fetched $3 million at auction last week, grading company CGC Cards announced in an Instagram post. This particular card is not only super rare, but also in pristine condition. 
âThe transaction went down in a private sale between Adam Cai of Pristine Collectibles and a mystery buyer, shattering previous records,â the post reads.
A post shared by CGC Cards (@cgccards)
In 2021, a signed Black Lotus card went for a record-high $511,100 at auction â a record broken not once, but twice in 2023, going for $615,000 at its highest. For comparison, just five years ago, the rare card went for $166,000. This most recent $3 million deal, though, doesnât just represent the highest sale price of a Black Lotus card, but the highest Magic: The Gathering card sale ever.
The previous record was set in 2023 by rapper Post Malone, when he purchased a rare Lord of the Rings-themed card for $2 million.
The Black Lotus card dates back to the first Alpha printing of Magic: The Gathering in 1993. Not only is it a rare card â only about 1,100 were printed â itâs a powerful one. It costs no mana to play but adds 3 mana of any color to your pool, so itâs a great shortcut to casting powerful spells early in the game. Itâs one of the âPower Nine,â a set of cards that has been banned from most formats of competitive play for their overwhelming power.

Buckshot Roulette passes 1 million sales after Steam launch,"Buckshot Roulette is an ugly, mean little game that pits players in a no-win scenario against a sinister, shotgun wielding dealer. The game is a solo effort from developer Mike Klubnika, and it blew up after its launch on itch.io, in part because it found popularity on short-form video platforms. The game has since launched on Steam and has now sold over a million copies. In a world where big-budget, wonderfully crafted games can â and often do â fall off the radar without making a splash, itâs interesting to interrogate the unexpected success of a small game, especially one thatâs designed to be so viscerally unpleasant.
âBuckshot Roulette was never meant to be a commercially viable product, or anything that extended beyond my usual audience. Even though the initial release did have a price tag, there was no actual calculations or accounting going on,â said Klubnika in an email interview with Polygon. âApart from the very basics, I knew nothing about game marketing, community building and such, so I just put it out there, hoping that other people will have fun with my idea.â
Klubnika has released other, similarly experimental games in the past. The Other Side is a bite-sized game about breaking out of an underground shelter thatâs been sealed off from the outside world. The player has to set up a clunky, shuddering drill and try to ensure it works long enough to create their escape. âPersonally I think horror games have a lot of room for experimentation compared to other genres,â said Klubnika. âWhen the main goal is to scare the player, the rest of the game can basically be anything, so you can pretty much do whatever you want.â
Buckshot Roulette was partially inspired by Inscryption, a similarly sinister card game, as well as other horror titles. Klubnika wanted to focus on an industrial horror aesthetic â rust, pounding music, dirty bathrooms, gritty sound effects. The central game of Russian roulette is already terrifying; amping it up with the surrounding context and the addition of shotguns helps push the envelope even further.  âThe eerie atmosphere of industrial horror always resonated with me on a deeper level compared to supernatural themes often explored in various projects,â Klubnika said.
Klubnikaâs next intended step for Buckshot Roulette is to expand it into a multiplayer game, where two players face off against each other. âOne of the key factors for expanding to Steam was being able to work on the feature using existing tools to support the online component,â says Klubnika. âI have lots of fun ideas on making this mode feel unique and challenging but also fair. Thereâs definitely a lot to explore when it comes to multiplayer-only items and match rules.â From there, Klubnika plans to launch the game on consoles and mobile stores.
The success of Buckshot Roulette is enough for Klubnika to be able to work full-time on game development, whereas he previously worked on projects parallel to work or university. âThis is not something I ever anticipated being part of a rather underground indie development scene, so it is very important to me, and I could not be more grateful,â said Klubnika. He also cited his partnership with publisher Critical Reflex as being incredibly helpful in launching the game to a wider audience.
The horror scene is going through a modern golden period, and while there are plenty of brilliant big-budget games in the genre, indie games are the ones that have been going to weirder, more experimental, and hideous new frontiers. Buckshot Roulette, similar to smaller games like Iron Lung, shows how these games can unexpectedly pop off and reach big audiences.

Sony revokes widely despised Helldivers 2 PSN linking policy,"In the days since Sony Interactive Entertainment announced an unpopular Helldivers 2 and PlayStation linking policy, players have been flooding the gameâs Steam page wil negative reviews. By Sunday, more than 200,000 of Helldivers 2âs 266,126 reviews on Steam were negative, filed in the aftermath of the disastrous announcement. But the review-bombing worked: Sony heard Helldivers 2 players and announced Monday that itâs no longer requiring Steam players to link a PlayStation Network account.
âHelldivers fans â weâve heard your feedback on the Helldivers 2 account linking update,â Sony wrote from the PlayStation X account. âThe May 6 update, which would have required Steam and PlayStation Network account linking for new players and for current players beginning May 30, will not be moving forward.â
Helldivers 2 game director and Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt added that heâs âimpressed by the willpower of the Helldivers 2 community.â Over the weekend, Pilestedt, who is known for his transparency on social media, had been updating players via X that Sony was in active conversation with Arrowhead over the policy, but that he didnât have the final say.
Firstly, I am impressed by the willpower of the @helldivers2 community and your ability to collaborate. Secondly I want to thank our partners and friends at @PlayStation for quickly and effectively making the decision to leave PSN linking optional. We together want to set a newâ¦ https://t.co/2rayksgH1v
The newly enforced policy was meant to begin with a May 6 update, forcing all new Helldivers 2 players to have and connect a PlayStation Network account to their Steam account. Current Helldivers 2 players had until May 30 to sign up for a PlayStation Network account and then link it. If they didnât do so, theyâd be unable to log into Helldivers 2. (The Helldivers 2 page has always had a small notice alerting players of the account-linking policy, but it had not been enforced and, seemingly, people just didnât see it.)
The community was immediately furious: Not only was the policy change sprung on them after they purchased the game, players had some legitimate concerns over creating PlayStation Network accounts. Some players pointed to a string of data breaches that Sonyâs been a victim of as reasoning for why they were unwilling to make a PlayStation Network account. Others, who were happily playing a game they purchased until recently, would soon be unable to access Helldivers 2 due to Sonyâs regional restrictions â there are more than 150 countries where players are unable to create legitimate PlayStation Network accounts. Briefly, Helldivers 2 became unavailable for sale in the countries unsupported by Sony.
Valve, which owns Steam, began issuing at least some refunds to Helldivers 2 players ahead of Sonyâs Monday morning announcement. Because of the change, however, Helldivers 2 players can now happily return to restoring democracy â and, perhaps, adjusting their negative reviews. Though the Helldivers 2 community is celebrating the win across Discord and Reddit, the chaotic weekend will certainly leave a sore spot for both Arrowhead and Sony.",https://www.polygon.com/24150011/helldivers-2-playstation-psn-linking-policy-revoked,2024-05-06 12:57:39
Apex Legendsâ new character goes full Harley Quinn,"Apex Legendsâ new character is ready to send herself â and everyone around her â into an apocalyptic spiral. Respawn Entertainment introduced its newest fighter to join the roster of playable characters to its popular online shooter on Friday. Her name is Alter, and the Harley Quinn-esque legend will bring a set of void-based powers to the popular online shooter, as shown in her trailer. 
She is just one of several new additions coming to Apex Legends as part of the shooterâs forthcoming Season 21, Upheaval. The Solos mode will be coming back at the start of the season and will replace Duos through late June. Meanwhile, the Broken Moon map is getting a significant overhaul, complete with new visuals and a drastic makeover of several points of interest. Respawn Entertainment shared more details about all the changes coming to the game in a blog on EAâs website. 
Alter seems like sheâll inject her fair share of commotion into matches. She looks like if you combined Harley Quinn with the mechanical arms of infamous Spider-Man villain Doc Ock. Her main gimmick revolves around void-based powers that allow her to create rifts in the map and use them to her advantage in skirmishes. It looks pretty cool if you ask me â and itâs looking like sheâll use them to inspire as much chaos as possible. 
Apex Legendsâ next season, Upheaval, will be available on May 7.",https://www.polygon.com/24148363/apex-legends-season-21-upheaval-alter-new-character,2024-05-03 21:10:00
Dropoutâs newest game show asks who wants to be a... thousandaire?,"The Dropout streaming service will expand its library this month with Thousandaires, a âwish fulfillment panel comedy series,â according to the companyâs news release. 
Some of the most riveting and heartwarming episodes of Dropoutâs flagship game show Game Changer have involved episodes with cash gifting, and Thousandaires looks to be inspired by that breakout hit. In each episode, a different selection of Dropout performers and friends are given one thousand American dollars to spend on âwhatever theyâd like that will best entertain viewers, each other and that episodeâs host.â The seasonâs hosts include Jacquis Neal, Jessica Ross, Oscar Montoya, Ryan Creamer, Erika Ishii, and Siobhan Thompson.
Judging by a first trailer for the series, that includes a âroller disco party,â âgoth makeovers,â a mechanical bull, fantasy-themed strippers, and... a time machine? At the end of the episode, the respective host will pick one contestant to receive an actual cash prize of $1k. 
Thousandaires will premiere on Dropout May 31, with new episodes of its six episode season airing every other week. ",https://www.polygon.com/24148149/dropout-thousandaires-release-date-premiere-trailer,2024-05-03 17:30:00
"Sex scenes in movies are in rapid decline, despite rise in sex-scene discourse","There has been so much time committed to yelling online about sex scenes in movies and TV â whether theyâre gratuitous, whether theyâre fundamental to a realistic portrayal of life, whether theyâre titillating fun, and whether they offend Penn Badgleyâs wife â that the discourse has now entered meme territory. But passionate defenders of hot-and-heavy drama might be right to make a ruckus over what they deem culturally valuable: According to a new study, the depiction of doinâ it in mainstream Hollywood movies has fallen dramatically over the last 20 years.
In a study conducted for The Economist, data researcher Stephen Follows looked at the 250 top-grossing films of each year since 2000 to plot out the amount of sex featured in major studio output (with a focus on positive encounters versus acts of sexual violence). What he found was a 40% drop in sexual content over the last two-plus decades. Another breakdown illustrates that the stat is directly linked to the amount of sex in major releases, rather than a shift by studios to dial down nudity and be more suggestive. Followsâ data-crunching found that nearly 50% of films released between 2019 and 2023 were void of sexual content, compared to around 20% in the early 2000s. The drop, he found, was particularly notable in action movies and thrillers produced in the window.
Sex hasnât disappeared from the movies â Emma Stone just snagged an Oscar and stuck it to prudes everywhere for her role as the sexually awakened Bella in last yearâs highly explicit Poor Things. The film was even a hit by arthouse standards, grossing $34 million in the United States and $117 million worldwide. But that total doesnât even put it in the top 50 highest-grossing films of 2023. Sex in movies is becoming an indie pursuit. (Though kudos to Oppenheimer for both being a gargantuan hit and including a scene in which its main character utters âI am become deathâ as he is mounted by his lover.)
Whatâs behind the apparent tightening up of Hollywoodâs self-imposed chastity belt? Follows lands on a conclusion that feels right: There has been a major cultural shift in how we talk about and consider sex. A greater focus on consent, gender representation, the male gaze, the on-set practices required for screen simulation, and the fine line between gratuitous and indecent have all created intense scrutiny around nudity and depictions of intimacy to the point where allowing them in films may not be worth the effort for studios (who, as we know, are in the business of profit, not art). The last 20 years have seen a shift toward a more global business, which also means appealing to global censors who decide if films can even open in a given country.
In previous research, Follows found that there has been a dramatic rise in on-set intimacy coordinators in the wake of the #MeToo conversation, as well, but any correlation to the actual depiction of sex feels dubious. The answers seem simpler, illuminated by Vulture critic Bilge Ebiriâs breakdown of the most important sex scenes in movie history. The list is littered with films from a category that was alive and well in the 1990s and early 2000s, but is now going extinct: the mid-budget drama. As the movie business blew up into four-quadrant blockbusters, studios lost the thread on creating buzz through the grounded human element. Sexy thrillers like Out of Sight, romantic dramas like Love & Basketball, or R-rated filmmaker-driven odysseys like Boogie Nights became rarities. The Marvel Way became THE Way â and the Marvel Way doesnât even do kissing all that right. Sure, intercourse discourse might turn marketing a movie in 2024 into a minefield, and intimacy coordinators might argue for whether a sex scene is âneededâ to tell a story, but Hollywood was stripping sex scenes from its output well before âGen Zâ started asking questions.
There are actors and filmmakers who will still fight to put sexuality on screen, producers who will gamble on its inclusion, and studios brave enough to put these movies out, but even truly bold movies in 2024 wouldnât pass Followsâ test. Challengers, a throuple drama lauded for making audiences tingle, is explicit in its sexuality but not so much in the sex â beyond some impassioned kissing, the deeper contact is only implied. (The movie is still hot as hell, but for sex-scene advocates, itâs not the juice.) And few movies on the 2024 release calendar will deliver. Unless Despicable Me 4 is hiding a really big secret, itâs going to be another year of minimal physical contact at the movies.

Helldivers 2 players on Steam now need a PlayStation account to play,"Helldivers 2 players whoâve been playing the game on Windows PC via Steam since launch will now need a PlayStation Network account to access the game. Helldivers 2 publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment posted a notice to the gameâs Steam page on Thursday informing Steam players of the change.
âDue to technical issues at the launch of Helldivers 2, we allowed the linking requirements for Steam accounts to a PlayStation Network account to be temporarily optional,â the publisher wrote. âThat grace period will now expire. See details below in this post.â
Sony claims account-linking with PlayStation Network is âcriticalâ to the âsafety and securityâ of Helldivers 2. âThis is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behaviour,â it said. âIt also allows those players that have been banned the right to appeal.â
Starting on May 6, all new Helldivers 2 players will be required to connect their Steam and PlayStation Network accounts before playing the game. Current Helldivers 2 players will begin to see the mandatory PlayStation Network log-in on May 30, and will need to have their accounts linked by June 4. You can sign up for a PlayStation Network account on the PlayStation website if you donât have one already.
From these dates on, Helldivers 2 players will be prompted to link their accounts when the game is launched. Youâll see a QR code and a link to the sign-in page for PlayStation Network, according to an FAQ page on Arrowheadâs website. By signing in there, youâll have your accounts linked. If you havenât created a PlayStation Network account before you follow the QR code or link, youâll then follow the instructions to make one â and the account will be automatically linked, Sony said.
Thereâs no way to link your accounts outside of this, so you wonât be able to do so as a current player until you start seeing the prompt pop up in-game.
Some Helldivers 2 players using Steam are furious â particularly that this wasnât a requirement from the beginning, and that players are suddenly forced to link up. One of the bigger problems is that some people wonât be able to create PlayStation Network accounts if they donât live in a region supported by Sony; South Africa is the only African country thatâs got PlayStation Network, for instance. Belarus and Lithuania arenât on the list. Based on Steamâs download statistics, thereâs not a ton of Steam traffic from these areas over the past seven days, but itâs still there. Sure, you could pick a different country, but that could require a VPN or risk a ban. There will likely be a number of players who purchased the game on Steam who will soon be unable to play.
The Helldivers 2 page does have a notice alerting players of the third-party account linking, however. It was just unenforced until now.
Other players are simply unwilling to give their information to Sony. Since Arrowhead posted the update, Helldivers 2 has received an influx of negative reviews on Steam â at the time of writing, hours after the post went live, Helldivers 2 has more than 6,000 new negative reviews, a dramatic increase from the 2,500 seen on April 25.
Weâve reached out to Sony Interactive Entertainment and Arrowhead for more information, and weâll update this post when they respond. ",https://www.polygon.com/24147958/helldivers-2-playstation-network-psn-account-link-how-to,2024-05-03 14:17:14
Xbox Game Passâ May lineup has cute kitty cats and Tomb Raider,"Two iconic video game characters join the Xbox Game Pass lineup this May: Lara Croft and an adorable little kitty. Sure, one character definitely has more brand name recognition over the other, but itâs hard to resist the adoring gaze of a big-eyed black cat. This month, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition and the charming indie game Little Kitty, Big City enter the catalog of games available for free on Xbox Games Pass. 
The number of Tomb Raider games on Xbox Games Pass just keeps growing. In April, the subscription service got Shadow of the Tomb Raider and the sequel to Rise of the Tomb Raider. Now, Xbox Games Pass subscribers will be able to revisit a modernized version of the game that started it all with Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition. Laraâs adventures will be complimented by small, but mighty additions to Xbox Game Pass this month. Cozy gamers and cat enthusiasts alike can look forward to scampering around in Little Kitty, Big City and those looking for a roguelite with solid combat and dark sense of humor can check out Have a Nice Death. 
The games round out a rather short list of additions coming to the subscription this month. Here are all the games coming to Xbox Game Pass in May, and where you can play them. 
As usual, some games will also be leaving the service. All of these games will be leaving Xbox Game Pass May 15: ",https://www.polygon.com/24147605/xbox-game-pass-may-2024-free-games-tomb-raider,2024-05-02 22:47:14
Hereâs everything changing in Diablo 4 with Loot Reborn,"Diablo 4âs new Loot Reborn update is nearly here, and will launch on May 14. Season 4âs theme is relatively light, it seems, but thatâs to make way for the gameâs biggest overhaul yet: loot. If you were tired of the classic âdamage on Tuesdaysâ affixes and the general chaos of the gameâs loot over the past year, Blizzard finally has you covered. 
Below, weâve highlighted some of the biggest changes coming with Loot Reborn on May 14. For the complete patch notes, keep scrolling down.
At launch, Diablo 4 had a bit of a problem when it came to its loot and loot affixes. There were too many situational effects that could roll onto weapons, making it really hard to get the affixes you want. And, even worse, these complex affixes could result in entirely dead affix spots, essentially bricking an otherwise good item.
Instead of affixes that are very specific, Diablo 4 is getting much broader in Loot Reborn. Now affixes might just read âX% bonus damageâ instead of the previous overcomplicated affixes from before (which inspired the âdamage on Tuesdaysâ meme). This should make crafting your perfect build and putting it together much easier, as most affixes will be useful for you at some point.
While most loot is getting simplified in Diablo 4, Blizzard is also adding in two new systems to help create depth for your items: Tempering and Masterworking.
Tempering allows you to replace and add affixes to your weapons, tailoring them to your needs. Masterworking compliments Tempering by allowing you to upgrade your affixes, essentially supercharging the item. Both of these systems will use endgame materials, but Masterworking specifically will use materials from the new, hyper-difficult dungeon: The Pit of Artificers.
Another old problem with Diablo 4 is that you got too much garbage loot while playing. And because you could upgrade your Rare items into Legendaries with the Codex of Power, you had to carefully comb through every single loot drop to make sure you didnât get perfect affixes on a random Rare item.
Starting in Loot Reborn, Legendaries will just be better than Rares in almost all cases, so at some point you can stop caring about non-Legendary items you pick up. Some of the Diablo 4 developers did hint that theyâre looking to make Rares useful again in the future, but for now you can just focus on Legendary items once youâre in the endgame.
Speaking of the Codex, itâs getting a major overhaul in Loot Reborn. Instead of only being able to earn certain Aspects for your Codex â and those Aspects always having worse stats than ones youâd find on a new item â you can now catalog all Legendary Aspects inside the Codex. Even better, you can extract Aspects from items directly into the Codex now, which upgrades that Legendary power for the rest of the season.
This means that if you find a max-rolled Aspect thatâs great for your class, you can extract it and reprint it at that same max-roll status forever.
There are tons of other big changes coming to D4 on May 14, including a free Legendary set of items via the Season Journey, another Helltide rework, and huge class changes â including buffs that should finally make Necromancerâs minions a viable option in the endgame. Check out the changes listed in the complete patch notes below:

Ryan Gosling brawled his way onto Jimmy Kimmel because he âcanât stop stuntingâ,"Surprising no one, Ryan Goslingâs press tour for The Fall Guy has been an absolute delight. Much like his many appearances promoting Barbie blurred the line between Gosling and Ken, the promo cycle for The Fall Guy has turned the Canadian dreamboat into a one-man hype train for stunts and the people that do them. The latest stop: Late Night with Jimmy Kimmel, where instead of simply walking over to the couch to chat, the actor staged a one-take fight scene through the studio set to Meatloafâs âIâd Do Anything for Love (But I Wonât Do That).â
Itâs a funny bit and an impressive thing to pull together for a late night segment, but funny bits come easy to Gosling, who is no stranger to showstopping numbers. Whatâs truly impressive is his continued commitment to giving stunt teams their shine, as the gang he fights through in the segment is his stunt team on The Fall Guy â and he ends his interview by bringing the whole four-man team on stage to highlight what each of them do. 
Beyond stunt work, the whole interview is a great time â thereâs a digression about meeting Burt Reynolds on Goslingâs first movie, who may or may not have been super into the young Ryan Goslingâs mom at the time â and Kimmel and Gosling get to break bottles over each others head, which I understand may be cathartic viewing for some.

Take-Two will reportedly close OlliOlli and Kerbal Space Program studios,"Bloomberg reports that Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two Interactive will close two game studios as part of a recently announced plan to lay off 5% of its workforce.
The two studios are London-based Roll7, developer of the much-loved OlliOlli skating games, and Intercept Games, a Seattle outfit formed by Take-Two to make Kerbal Space Program 2.
Both studios were part of Take-Twoâs boutique publishing label Private Division. It seems Private Division, probably best known for publishing Obsidian Entertainmentâs The Outer Worlds, will be heavily impacted in the Take-Two layoffs. GamesIndustry.biz reports that the âvast majorityâ of Private Division staff in Seattle, New York, Las Vegas, and Munich have been laid off.
Roll7 broke through with old-school skateboarding game OlliOlli in 2013. It was acquired by Private Division in 2021 ahead of the releases of OlliOlli World and competitive skater-shooter Rollerdrome in 2022.
Randomly just thinking about when we won a BAFTA last year â¤ï¸ https://t.co/mEEa8mploK
Intercept Games was formed by Private Division in 2020 to take over development of Kerbal Space Program 2 from original developer Star Theory Games. Star Theory subsequently shut down. Reports that Intercept Games was to follow suit began to circulate on Wednesday after Take-Two filed a notice in Washington State that it would close an office in Seattle, affecting 70 workers.
In a statement, Take-Two did not confirm the studio closures, but said that Private Division âcontinues to make updates to Kerbal Space Program 2,â which is currently in early access. It also pointed to Private Divisionâs releases of No Rest for the Wicked and upcoming cozy Lord of the Rings game Tales of the Shire. It said Take-Two was ânot providing additional detailsâ on its cost reduction program, other than to say it was ârationalizing its pipeline and eliminating several projects in development and streamlining its organizational structure.â
Take-Two announced its reorganization on April 16, saying it would shed 5% of staff, roughly 580 employees. The news came shortly after the publisher agreed to purchase Borderlands studio Gearbox Entertainment from Embracer for $480 million. The company is also preparing to release Rockstar Gamesâ Grand Theft Auto 6 in 2025.",https://www.polygon.com/24147065/take-two-layoffs-roll7-intercept-games-closure,2024-05-02 13:19:45
The forbidden episode of Bluey is forbidden no more,"If youâve never seen the episode of beloved Australian kidsâ cartoon Bluey that Disney refuses to screen for American audiences, nowâs your chance. âDad Babyâ has been uploaded in full to the official Bluey YouTube channel.
In the episode, Bluey and Bingo, the irrepressible Blue Heeler pups, play a game with their dad Bandit in which he pretends to be pregnant with Bingo and to give birth to her in a pool in their backyard. Like all episodes of Bluey, itâs very funny and lovingly grounded in the realities of family life.
Although the episode has been screened on TV in Blueyâs native Australia, in the U.K., and elsewhere, Disney â which holds the American TV rights and the global streaming rights for the show â has never broadcast âDad Babyâ or uploaded it to the Disney Plus streaming service.
Disney has not commented on its decision to censor âDad Baby.â Itâs likely due to sensitivity about one of two things: a depiction of the realities of childbirth that, in some conservative quarters, might be considered too honest for preschoolers â itâs not exactly graphic, but thereâs no doubt about where Bingo is being pushed out from â or the gender-bending depiction of a man (well, male dog) giving birth.
It seems Blueyâs rights holders, a small Australian animation outfit called Ludo Studio, have tired of the suppression of the episode and have decided to make it free to watch on YouTube. It remains unavailable on Disney Plus.
Bluey recently completed its third season with special episode âThe Sign.â Though its creators have said Bluey and her family will be back, the showâs future remains uncertain, with a fourth season yet to be confirmed.

Star Wars: The Old Republic gets cozy with a new farming homestead,"A new developer stream for Star Wars: The Old Republic showed a surprising feature on the way in Game Update 7.5. Players will be able to earn their own farmstead on the planet of Dantooine after completing a quest chain. The cozy feature will come with a Spring Abundance festival, which includes the surprisingly comfortable activities of âseed collecting, dancing, pie-baking, animal rehabilitation, and a galactic egg hunt,â according to a press release.
Star Wars: The Old Republic has been live for 13 years, and thereâs a huge archive of content for players to enjoy. Ten months ago, the MMORPG changed hands from its original developer BioWare to Broadsword, the studio behind Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot. While The Old Republic has faded from the spotlight, itâs still a very enjoyable game thatâs worth revisiting to scratch a Star Wars itch.
Broadsword is taking the game in an intriguing direction. Patch 7.4.1 included Date Night companion missions, which are exactly what youâd expect from the name. These missions become available if the companion has been romanced, and is available in a playerâs story â some circumstances can cause your partner of choice to leave the party. Date Night missions will be released in batches, and they grant a unique title and decoration.
Update 7.5 also includes a new main story chapter where players wrangle with a Hutt, and new single-player Ventures that are meant to provide a challenging experience. Players train up their very own Basilisk Prototype B3-S1 (or Bessie) and prepare them for combat. Eventually, Bessie joins your team as a permanent companion. The release date for Update 7.5 will be announced soon. ",https://www.polygon.com/24146695/star-wars-the-old-republic-farming-homestead-date-night-broadsword,2024-05-01 21:21:52
Iâm very scared of Helldivers 2âs new fight against the Terminid threat,"I regret to inform you that, despite the best efforts of Helldivers everywhere, the Terminid threat is back and nastier than ever. Iâm starting to think that Super Earth command may not know exactly what theyâre doing â but, of course, I would never linger on such undemocratic thoughts.
Helldivers 2 is telling a fascinating story of endless war through its Order system. Every time I log in, Iâm greeted with a couple of missions to do. The Personal Order is always some simple task, like killing some Chargers, or extracting from a mission with some good samples on me. The Major Order, however, plays out over the course of a few days. Each Major Order asks all Helldivers to collaborate on a common objective. For example, one Major Order was to activate a chemical called Termicide on a bunch of Terminid planets. We were assured that this safe, soothing chemical would solve our bug problem.
For the last few weeks, weâve been ensnared with Automatons. Nearly every Major Order as of late has been focused on those damnable bots, with only a couple of exceptions â there was one two-front defense against both factions, and one glorious Major Order to stomp two billion bugs. But for the vast majority of my recent playtime, Iâve been on the front with my fellows dealing with the robot menace. We fought to exterminate the Automatons, and even briefly cleared them off the galactic map as a threat, before they returned with terrifying new tools like gunships. The last Major Order had us hold a defensive line against both Automaton factions, and we barely succeeded.
Breaking: Terminids break containment! On TCS Barrier Planets the bugs have begun to display hyper-reproductive adaptation and resistance to Termicide.Are the disgraced scientists who developed it to blame? pic.twitter.com/K4dwXeyqMF
Now, we have a new set of orders from Super Earth, and it turns out the Termicide thing may have backfired. For instance, did you know Stalkers are now completely invisible? Thatâs a mutation that I donât care for, and I would prefer they stop this monkey business immediately. As the new broadcast from Super Earth reads, âThe Terminid control system has failed. Meridia has turned into a supercolony. Termicide may be causing faster reproduction. The TCS must be deactivated immediately.â
Now, thereâs a new mission type called Deactivate, where players go and clear out the massive, gooey nests that have formed around the Terminid Control System towers. Weâve seen Terminids evolve in the past, like when new flying bugs emerged (and were briefly denied entirely by Super Earth command.) After the Automaton debacle, players are expecting new and nasty bugs to emerge. 
Arrowhead Games has pulled off an impressive feat with their narrative, balancing the goofy humor of the game with engaging objectives. Iâll be reporting for duty, and Iâm praying that we donât see any new baddies emerge. The gunships are bad enough; Iâm shaking and trembling just thinking about what new Terminid enemies might join the fray.",https://www.polygon.com/24146443/helldivers-2-major-orders-terminid-mutation-invisible-stalkers-narrative,2024-05-01 17:45:00
Starfieldâs most annoying feature just got nerfed,"Bethesda Game Studios is fixing one of the worst things about Starfield â its maps. The lack of readable maps was one of my biggest gripes with the spacefaring adventure game; regardless of how many times I visited a city, I got lost. Thankfully, thatâs changing. Itâs an essential part of Starfieldâs latest patch, which is currently in beta, that also adjusts several other annoying issues with the game. Bethesda doesnât have a release date for the patch just yet, but it shouldnât be too long.
âWeâve heard your feedback, and weâve made some big improvements to surface maps, so youâll always know just where to go and no longer âget lostâ on the way to your parentsâ place (and they werenât buying that excuse anyway, you should really go visit them),â a Microsoft representative wrote in the latest Starfield patch notes.
The next-best update thatâs part of this patch is expanded difficulty options; the example Bethesda pulled out is that you can make ground combat harder but ship combat easier. As someone who found Starfieldâs ship combat occasionally infuriatingly hard, I love this change. The other big change is the ability to decorate your ship like you can with outposts, forgoing the way you had to previously (i.e. just imprecisely dropping stuff everywhere). Now, you can use tools to place your stuff exactly where you want it to go.
Beyond that, thereâs a new way to manage container inventory, and there are new traits and dialogue settings. Frame rate fanatics will also now be able to play Starfield at 60 frames per second. Here are the display updates, straight from Bethesda:
Frame Rate Target: You can now choose between 30, 40, 60 or an Uncapped frame rate on VRR displays. If you do not have a VRR display running 120hz, you will still be able to select from 30 or 60. Screen tearing may occur at times when selecting 60 on a non-VRR display.
Prioritize: You can now prioritize between Visuals and Performance while trying to maintain the frame rate target. If youâre choosing a frame rate target of 60 or above, we recommend changing this to Performance. Prioritizing Visuals keeps the highest resolution while maintaining full detail for special effects, lighting, and crowds. Prioritizing Performance lowers internal resolution and detail for special effects, lighting, and crowds. Both modes may adjust internal resolution dynamically when scenes or action get heavier as well. When switching between modes, you will see the lighting change briefly as the system catches up to the new mode.
The rest of the updates are bug fixes, which you can read about on the Starfield website.
While these updates are essential, it may be too little, too late for a lot of Starfield players. Starfield publisher Microsoft is, however, reportedly targeting a September release date, The Verge reported, for the gameâs Shattered Space DLC â a big update thatâll bring players back to the game.

Diablo 4âs next season heralds a major reset â and itâs all in the name,"Blizzard has published a blog detailing the changes coming to Diablo 4 in its crucial fourth season, and given the season a name that lays it all out in the open: itâs called Loot Reborn. The focus of the season is completely revamping Diablo 4âs weak and fussy item game, making equipment drops more impactful and easier to understand.
Season 4, which begins on May 14, will work as a massive reset for Diablo 4âs underpinning systems â something thatâs evident from the fact most of the content and changes will apply to the gameâs main Eternal Realm as well as the time-limited Seasonal Realm for seasonal characters.
The name, Loot Reborn, reflects Blizzardâs focus on these changes over the seasonal storyline (although there will be one featuring the Iron Wolves, a mercenary faction from Diablo 2). Itâs also surely a callback to âLoot 2.0â, a Diablo 3 update that arrived alongside the Reaper of Souls expansion and dramatically improved the game in the eyes of many in the Diablo community.
The content of the changes wonât be a surprise to players whoâve been following Diablo 4 closely, as Blizzard has been open about its plans in developer updates, and held the gameâs first Public Test Realm testing session in April to gather feedback.
Briefly: Loot will drop less often and have fewer affixes, while those affixes will be more powerful and easier to understand. Thereâll be fewer of the arcane, conditional effects (like a bonus to damage against non-injured Elite enemies) that would leave players scratching their heads or shrugging when trying to figure out the efficacy of an item for their character build (or at all). The gem system has been streamlined, as has the Codex of Power, a collection of the powerful Aspect affixes that can be applied to high-quality loot. The aim across the board is to reduce busywork for the player.
It wouldnât be Diablo if there wasnât some arcane complexity, however, so this has been shifted into two new crafting systems: Tempering, which allows players to collect and add additional affixes to their equipment, and Masterworking, an endgame system that supercharges your weapons using rare resources from a new dungeon type, the Pit of Artificers.
Alongside the loot changes, Helltides get a major revamp. These world events see demons take over large swathes of the game map for limited periods, and theyâre a crucial part of late-game and endgame play in Diablo 4. The redesigned Helltides have a threat level that increases as the player kills monsters, directing more of the demon army toward them. Helltides will also become available earlier in the game, in World Tiers 1 and 2.
Blizzard didnât say much about the Iron Wolves storyline for season 4 in the blog, and itâs unclear if this is because itâs rather slender compared to previous seasons, or because the developer is just being secretive. Itâs notable that some of the content featuring the Iron Wolves will persist past the end of the season, which hasnât been true of any of the previous seasons.
After an underwhelming third season and criticism of the item game that has persisted since launch, Loot Reborn could be a make-or-break moment for Diablo 4 â even as it welcomes a new wave of players from Game Pass and builds up to the release of first expansion Vessel of Hatred in late 2024.
Blizzard will go into greater detail about Season 4: Loot Reborn in a developer update livestream on Thursday, May 2, at 2 p.m. EDT/11 a.m. PDT, after which it says it will publish full patch notes.

Workers seek to alter the balance of power in Canadian video game industry,"Video game workers in Quebec, under the Game Workers Unite Montreal banner, are partnering with Canadian trade union ConfÃ©dÃ©ration des syndicats nationaux (CSN) in an effort to shape the industry for the better. Together, theyâre launching a union drive to form a provincewide union for Quebec-based video game workers. Quebec is home to nearly 15,000 workers, according to GWU Montreal, at studios like Behaviour Interactive, Ubisoft, Warner Bros. Games, Electronic Arts, and Gameloft, making it a hotbed for the industry and its workers.
Together, theyâre hoping to make not just one or two studios a better place to work â but all of them. âThe general public loves games and consumes them on a daily basis, but has no idea how games are made, or by who,â Marie, a game writer, told Polygon. (Marie requested to be identified by their first name only because their employer doesnât know that theyâre organizing.) âItâs an opportunity for us to take that fight, that work weâve been doing for years, to a larger platform.â

Game Workers Unite has operated for years as a democratic workersâ organization, but was not itself a union. Now thatâs changing: Under CSN, Game Workers Unite Montreal members (which span all of Quebec, not just Montreal) will have access to many more resources. Workers will join individual unions tied to studios, each of which will negotiate with their own employers, CSN president Caroline Senneville told Polygon. 
âThis structure will ensure the development of solidarity between studios, sharing of collective knowledge, and collaboration around common issues,â Senneville said. âUnion members will be able to collectively decide on which demands rally around, all while guaranteeing autonomy to its local components. A province-wide union gives a greater balance of power to the workers as they form a bigger group. This will benefit all, but especially small studios.â
Thereâs a lot to love about the video game industry, according to Marie â itâs a young, modern field full of passionate, creative people. âBut maybe the public doesnât know that itâs an industry on fire,â they said, referring to the mass layoffs and studio closures that have plagued the business for several years now; nearly 10,000 people have been laid off this year alone. Thatâs on top of brutal workloads, low pay, crunch hours, and, sometimes, physical and mental abuse. Rida Hamdani, who previously worked in quality assurance, told Polygon that job stability was a huge problem in that sector: Working on a contract, you could have work one week and none the next.
With CSN, GWU Montreal will become a bigger destination for answers and help. âWhat are the standards for working conditions?â Hamdani said. âWhat are the labor laws? Is this normal? Thatâs all things weâve been doing for a while, but with the help of the CSN, itâs going to make it easier for workers in the game industry to have access to that information and legal help to know their rights.â
The ability to negotiate union contracts, too, will let workers leverage this information into actual change.

    Related
  
It can be easy to separate the worker from the product â in this case, video games â but Marie and Hamdani are hoping the union drive can help humanize the industry. They want players to understand that unionization not only impacts workers and their livelihoods, but gaming itself. Itâs not only the ethically right thing to do to support other humansâ right to safe, equitable work; itâll impact games being made, too.
âIf the industry continues to go the way itâs been going these last few years with studio closures and game projects being canceled because of mass layoffs, itâs going to be a big loss for players,â Marie said. âItâs in playersâ interest to educate themselves about how a game is made. Who is making games, and in what condition? Itâs a creative industry, and the industry lies on workersâ backs.â
âThe people who make games deserve the same respect that games themselves get,â said Hamdani.",https://www.polygon.com/24145830/game-workers-unite-csn-union-2024,2024-05-01 08:00:00
"Legend of Zelda movie needs to be âgroundedâ and âreal,â says director","Nintendoâs Legend of Zelda movie wonât be as heavy on the motion capture as director Wes Ball once envisioned. 
Back in 2010, long before Nintendo announced Ball as the guy in charge of the long-anticipated fantasy adaptation, and even before he had directed his first feature, The Maze Runner, the director tweeted that he thought an entirely mo-cap version of The Legend of Zelda, along the lines of James Cameronâs Avatar, would be a great idea. But after working with Weta FX on Mayâs mo-cap-intensive movie Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, it seems he has other things in mind for Link.
In an interview with Polygon, Ball said that an entirely mo-capped version The Legend of Zelda âprobably isnât his choice,â with a laugh. Instead, he said the project has to be a little more âgroundedâ and âreal.â But Ball was also careful to say that he couldnât say much about the movie just yet. 
âWeâre working hard, and weâre gonna make something great,â he said before joking that if he said much more âNintendo will pop out of the bushes here and like yank me away.â 
Ball is a major proponent of animation, having broke into the industry with his stylized CG animated short Ruin before directing three Maze Runner films. After wrapping the trilogy, he developed an animated take on The Mouse Guard, though the ambitious feature fell apart after Disney acquisition of 20th Century Fox. But the studio was clearly a fan, putting Ball in charge of the next chapter in the Apes franchise â a film that would reunite him with Weta and put his rare aptitude for live-action and animation to the test. Ball may have imagined a fully animated Legend of Zelda movie 14 years ago, but he basically achieved his Avatar dreams with Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.
âLike Avatar, and unlike the other previous Apes movies, thereâs about 30 or 40 minutes of full CG in this movie. Like every leaf, every piece of bark, you know, full CG. So I got to have a little taste of that Avatar experience, where itâs just actors on a mocap stage pretending with all this crazy boxes and proxies for objects. That was really fun.â
Thereâs no word yet on when we can expect The Legend of Zelda, which was only announced last November, but Ballâs Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is out in theaters on May 10.",https://www.polygon.com/24145926/zelda-movie-director-wes-ball-grounded-style,2024-05-01 02:30:00
Call of Duty makes its return to the Xbox Showcase stage,"Microsoft has announced the timing of the next Xbox Games Showcase, to be livestreamed on June 9 at 1 pm ET. Just like last year, the event will unfold on the Sunday of Summer Game Fest, which kicks off on June 7 via livestreams and in-person events in Los Angeles. Also similar to last year, where Xboxâs showcase was followed by the Starfield Direct livestream, this yearâs showcase will be followed by a deep dive on an upcoming game â and according to The Vergeâs reporting, thatâs Call of Duty.
Although itâs not yet confirmed, Call of Duty fans online have extensively speculated that upcoming game will be Call of Duty Black Ops Gulf War, whose development has been rumored for quite some time. The Call of Duty fandom has been invigorated by this news, with many highlighting how long itâs been since the franchise has been showcased in this way. 
âLast time Call of Duty was part of Xbox Showcase was Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare in June 2014,â wrote CharlieIntel, mainstay of the Call of Duty community, on X (formerly Twitter).
Itâs an interesting time for Call of Duty to return to the forefront of Xboxâs portfolio, as well, given that last year was the first time that the annual franchise entry got outsold by another game. 2023âs best-selling game was Hogwarts Legacy, breaking Call of Dutyâs long-running streak. Thatâs worldwide sales, however; in the United States, Call of Duty is still at the top of the heap, making it a reliable and non-risky choice for Xboxâs showcase this year.
As for the rest of the showcase, Microsoftâs announcement says itâll include its âportfolio of studios across Activision, Blizzard, Bethesda and Xbox Game Studios, in addition to titles from our third-party partners.â ",https://www.polygon.com/24145559/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops,2024-04-30 18:28:56
Sea of Thievesâ newest update includes 7 hilarious tools,"Sea of Thieves launches on the PlayStation 5 today, and the pirate game is getting a patch packed full of new tools. In Sea of Thieves, players take up the role of a pirate crew, manning a sloop, brigantine, or galleon to go on adventures and battle nautical foes like the kraken and  skeleton ships. The gameâs new season introduces a ton of new toys to try on the high seas, and theyâre guaranteed to cause some chaos.
First off, there are two new weapons: an extra damaging double-barrel pistol, and throwing knives to toss â but which then must be picked up or refilled. These join other pirate standards from the arsenal, like a saber, a sniper rifle, a pistol, and a blunderbuss.
The Bone Caller is an intriguing new bauble. When itâs smashed â either by throwing it at your feet, or launching it into an enemy ship via cannon â it summons some friendly skeletons to hack and slash on behalf of your crew. The Horn of Fair Winds is another bauble that, when blown upon, sends out a gust of wind. Pirates can use it to slow their fall, blast away enemies, or fill their sails. The trick is that it applies to both allies and enemies, so be careful to not send your crew overboard with a mistimed gust.
There are also two new options for ship-to-ship combat. Scattershot is short range, which makes it harder to nail an enemy vessel, but it has a chance to create multiple holes, which are a pain for the enemy crew to patch up.

For those prepared to board, the harpoon tightrope creates a very narrow bridge between ships. Up until now, players have had to sneak up the ladders on the side of a ship, or launch themselves aboard with clever use of a cannon. The harpoon tightrope creates a new option, which should help make naval combat riskier for both parties.
Finally, ziplines first showed up in the Monkey Island crossover campaign content, but now theyâll be available in the open world. Ziplines are a great way to zip through larger islands and avoid long runs. 
The new update also has seasonal rewards, including new ship parts and pirate cosmetics, and items in the pirate emporium cash shop. This includes a new owl pet, which looks like itâll be a hoot.

Stardew Valleyâs cookbook feels like cooking with the gameâs cozy characters,"More than a month has passed since developer Eric âConcernedApeâ Barone released the big 1.6 update for Stardew Valley, but the fun isnât over yet. Barone teamed up with writer Ryan Novak to craft the Official Stardew Valley Cookbook. Publisher Random House Worlds will launch the book on May 14. You can already pre-order it from online retailers like Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Bookshop.org.
This book contains 50 recipes, and, true to Stardew Valleyâs emphasis on harvesting seasonal ingredients, these scrumptious selections are divided into seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter). Each recipe is inspired by food found in the game and is complemented with original art and photography of the dishes. The best part? Fans of the game will enjoy how the book ties together the food with the memorable characters of Stardew Valley. 
Each recipe tells you which character the recipe belongs to, and the bookâs margins are lined with adorable notes from the cast of the game. For example, the crab cake recipe has a note from Elliot that comments on how he âcannot help but partake of their sweet meats when formed into cakes and drizzled with lemon.â Itâs a small but cute detail, since fans of Elliot may already know that he loves to receive crab cakes as a gift in the game. 
A major part of playing Stardew Valley entails growing fresh ingredients, then cooking them to create tasty, regenerative meals. That said, the gameâs rudimentary recipes have been reimagined to reflect the fact that theyâre more complex to make in real life. For example, while baking a Pink Cake in the game only requires four ingredients (melon, wheat flour, sugar, and an egg), the book supplies a recipe for a delicious-looking watermelon strawberry jam. 
There are other clever recipe adaptations in this cookbook. One that stuck out to me was the Lucky Lunch. The dish requires sea cucumber in the game, but the cookbook version of that dish turns it into shrimp ceviche on a bed of greens with a star-shaped tortilla to top it off. Safe to say, I donât think my local grocery stores carry fleshy sea slugs, so I welcome the change to shrimp. 
Iâve reported on how Stardew Valley has inspired people to start gardens of their own. Some folks might not be into picking up farming as a hobby, but maybe now with the The Official Stardew Valley Cookbook, you might want to get crackinâ in the kitchen instead. If nothing else, this book is a unique way to let fans of the game spend a little bit more time with their favorite characters.

Palworld is getting a frog with a stick (and 3 other new Pals),"Spring has sprung and that means new creatures coming to the chaotic, monster-filled lands of Palworld. Developer Pocketpair revealed four new Pals heading to the hit survival monster-catching game on Monday. The brief trailer showed four new Pals that will join the growing roster of creatures in the game. Pocketpair did not share a release date for the new Pals. 
There are four new creatures in total: a frog, an ostrich, an anthropomorphized dog-type thing, and a goofy looking mushroom with a face. Each one is special in its own way and fall in-line with other Pals in the game has so far. The design of the mushroom-thing and its face reminds me of the brainless look of the beloved Pal, Relaxaurus. However, after seeing the trailer, I think I just want to run around alongside the frog with a stick. 
The developers have been adding new content to the game since its release last January. In March, the team added its first raid battle and a new Pal called Bellanoir. Pocketpair shared a brief look at a new PvP mode coming to the game in April and it planned to be released later this year. Now this announcement said team has plans to release âmany more new Pals in future updates,â on X via the official account.

Sounds like the Switch 2 has Joy-Cons that attach magnetically,"A pair of recent reports have suggested that Nintendoâs successor to the Switch console â which we, along with everyone else, are calling Switch 2 for now â will have Joy-Con controllers that attach to the body of the device using strong, electronically-controlled magnets, rather than the sliding rail system used by the Switch.
The news was first broken by Vandal, a Spanish site with a fairly good track record on leaks. Oddly, it was then confirmed in a blog post by Mobapad, a third-party manufacturer of Switch peripherals and controllers. Vandalâs sources were also manufacturers of peripherals and accessories.
Mobapadâs surprisingly detailed report says the new Joy-Cons use âmagnetic suctionâ to attach to the console, âthrough electromagnetic suction technology, controlled by electric current.â This sounds like electropermanent magnets, which have a strong magnetic field that can be switched on or off by a pulse of electric current. Presumably, the user would click a button to attach or detach the controllers.
Mobapad says the new Joy-Cons are larger and feature additional buttons: new buttons on the left and right sides (perhaps to control the magnets), plus a new function button below the Home button on the right Joy-Con. The SL and SR buttons (the buttons which serve as L and R when the Joy-Con is detached and being used as a solo controller) are now made from metal, apparently. Mobapad also confirmed that HD rumble is still enabled through ALPS dual-axis linear motors.
Mobapad says the console is fully backward-compatible, including with physical game cartridges for Switch as well as digital games. The existing Pro Controller and Joy-Cons are supported by the new machine â although, presumably, Switch 1 Joy-Cons canât be attached to the console due to the new magnetic system.
Mobapad says the Switch 2âs dock will use the same USB-C connection as the existing dock, support 4K display resolution, and feature âminor changesâ in appearance. Confusingly, the company also mentioned the new dock having a âdamping bracket on the back, allowing for a greater range of adjustable angles,â which sounds like it might actually refer to the kickstand on the back of the console itself.
Mobapad also confirmed earlier reports that the Switch 2 will have a larger, 8-inch screen, supporting 1080p resolution.
Vandal supplied a wonderful detail about the secrecy surrounding demos of the Switch 2 hardware to peripheral manufacturers. Reportedly, Nintendoâs partners were invited to put their hands inside an âopaque boxâ so they could handle the machine and get a feel for its dimensions and ergonomics, without actually being able to see it. Yes, thatâs right â they were subjected to the Gom Jabbar test. 
Neither report made any mention of the dual, detachable screens seen in a recent Nintendo patent. Mobapad noted the consoleâs âconservative approachâ â according to these and other sources, Nintendo is preparing to release a straightforward follow-up to the Switch with largely the same features as, and extensive compatibility with, the earlier machine.",https://www.polygon.com/24144429/switch-2-magnetic-joy-cons-backward-compatible,2024-04-29 17:03:54
Return to the Pridelands with the first trailer for Mufasa: The Lion King,"After the massive success of 2019âs âlive-actionâ Lion King, it only made sense for Disney to explore more of that photorealistic CG world. Instead of adapting the direct-to-home-video sequel The Lion King: Simbaâs Pride, or the Disney Junior series The Lion Guard, though, the next movie will delve into the backstory of Simbaâs father, Mufasa. 
Itâs a prequel, but itâs also a little bit of the sequel, since apparently the framing device involves the daughter of Simba and Nala. And it appears that Mufasaâs origins are surprising, because the trailer opens up on a snowy mountain instead of the savanna from the original movies. 
The official synopsis is as follows: 
Mufasa: The Lion King enlists Rafiki to relay the legend of Mufasa to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature schtick. Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Takaâthe heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destinyâtheir bonds will be tested as they work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe.  
Hardcore Lion King fans will recognize that âTakaâ is actually Scarâs given name. So it seems like this prequel will show how Mufasa usurped the divine right to rule by being a more competent leader. And hey! If they ever adapt future Kiaraâs story, maybe theyâll turn it from a star-crossed romance into a tale of the young lioness introducing democracy to the Pridelands. 
Directed by Academy Award-winning director Barry Jenkins (Moonlight), Mufasa: The Lion King stars Aaron Pierre (Old) as Mufasa, with Kelvin Harrison Jr. (Chevalier) as Taka. John Kani, Donald Glover, and BeyoncÃ© reprise their role as Rafiki, Simba, and Nala, respectively, with Blue Ivy Carter (BeyoncÃ©âs daughter, yâall!!!!!!!!!!) making her debut as Kiara. Lin-Manuel Miranda will be writing new songs for the movie.
Mufasa: The Lion King is scheduled to hit theaters on Dec. 20.",https://www.polygon.com/24144281/mufasa-trailer-lion-king-prequel-release-date,2024-04-29 14:04:00
Bungie is reversing its decision to sunset weapons for Destiny 2: The Final Shape,"Destiny 2: The Final Shape is fast approaching, and weâve reached the point where every weekly blog post has some bombshell to shake up the community. But on Thursday, Bungie dropped some of the biggest news that veteran players have ever seen: Destiny 2âs weapons are getting un-sunset.
Yes, when The Final Shape rolls around, Bungie will remove power limits from all legacy gear. Players will be able to upgrade any legacy gear to current power standards, meaning that all weapons will be usable in the expansionâs new content and the rest of the game. 
A brief history lesson for the new Guardians out there or for those who stopped playing before Beyond Light. In 2020, Bungie introduced what the community calls âweapon sunsetting.â The idea was that, in order to entice players to use new things, Bungie would remove the ability to infuse (power up) gear of a certain age. So, weapons from the old Leviathan raid, Forsaken, and even seasons like Dawn eventually became obsolete. This wasnât because new guns were better (although thatâs certainly the case now); Bungie blocked the playerâs ability to infuse those weapons up to the new power levels, meaning they just did less damage than other options.
Sunsetting was met with a lot of backlash during the Beyond Light era, and Bungie quickly turned around and announced that it would no longer be sunsetting any gear coming to Destiny 2. However, the damage was done to the legacy items from before Shadowkeep and Season of the Dawn, and those weapons have remained âsunsetâ ever since.
With this new update, Guardians can now infuse every piece of gear up to the max power limits if theyâd like. This is extremely exciting for longtime players, as beloved weapons that have sat dormant for years and years in their vaults will be available to use in the fight against The Witness.
However, there are two major problems here. First, many players â myself included â have deleted some of these beloved weapons, as Vault space is limited and the guns didnât really have a use anymore. For instance, Iâve only kept two weapons from that era, purely out of nostalgia: my original Midnight Coup and my Inaugural Address, both from the Leviathan raid.
The second problem is that these guns just arenât as powerful as new weapons. They donât have access to the newer, extremely powerful perks Bungie has added since 2020. And they straight up donât have an Origin Trait, which is a new perk slot that ties weapon families together that Bungie added in The Witch Queen expansion.
Bungie did offer good news on both of those fronts, however. While there arenât any ways to help players recover beloved weapons that theyâve deleted, Bungie does have plans to introduce new sources for players to get âmostâ of these old guns back. And theyâll all be updated to modern Destiny 2 standards, including with new Origin Traits.
The reason for this change is the new Fireteam Power system, which Bungie also discussed in this blog post. Starting in The Final Shape, the highest Power player in the Fireteam will elevate everyone else to just five Power below their level. Under sunsetting, this wouldâve allowed the boosted players to bypass that mechanic entirely, hence its removal. 
The studio also announced a variety of convenient Power changes coming in The Final Shape on June 4, including account-wide Power to help players with multiple characters level up faster, and clearer indicators of how difficult an activity will be. You can read more about those features in Bungieâs weekly blog.
With all this in mind, we have an explainer on how to prepare for The Final Shape, making sure youâre all set for the raid release in the days that follow.",https://www.polygon.com/24140650/destiny-2-the-final-shape-sunsetting-weapons-power-bungie,2024-04-25 21:46:17
"A new Escape from Tarkov special edition finally offers offline PvE, for just $250","If you want to play Escape from Tarkov offline with friends, it looks like itâs going to cost you. Developer Battlestate Games announced a new special edition of the game, called The Unheard Edition, on Thursday that comes with a lot of exclusive features and content, including an offline, co-op PvE mode, for $250. 
Many players have bought other editions that have granted them special features, like access to the early test server, more equipment, and a larger stash, so The Unheard Editionâs existence isnât anything new. However, a previous edition, called Edge of Darkness, was discontinued in January, and promised that buyers would have access to all future DLC through a season pass. So the assumption among players was that the PvE mode would be considered DLC.
Lead community manager Daniel Mavlyuberdinov, who goes by the handle âappl3z0r,â explained in the official Discord that the DLC season pass did not apply to the new PvE mode or any other features in The Unheard Edition. âDLC means additional downloadable content. PvE is a feature and a gamemode. Just because you all want it to become a DLC it wouldnt mean it is one. Itâs featured game mode for the new edition of the game,â he wrote.
As to whether the PvE mode will be available for other players, Mavlyuberdinov continued that itâll be a âunique featureâ for Unheard Edition buyers, although the company will keep Edge of Darkness owners updated on new features. The message was also reiterated on X. Edge of Darkness players, who already paid $150 for their version of the game, can save some money if they want access to the PvE mode â to the tune of $100. 
PvE mode is a unique feature which is available only for the owners of The Unheard Edition.We will keep you updated on new features exclusive for EOD owners#EscapefromTarkov
In addition, Tarkov players have noted The Unheard Edition will feature unique weapons and more flea market slots. Characters will also not lose progression and will have an increased starting level after a server wipe. Longtime players will remember a time without server wipes, wherein players who could collect the most loot during a run (which got added to their permanent collection) would destroy newer players. The server wipe resets everybody to the same level, so players that pay for the new bundle will have a big advantage.
The news has not been met well by the community. Fans have taken to calling the edition pay to win. Discord members have taken to copy and pasting a note that reads in part, âFor 8 years, weâve been recommending this game to friends, bringing more and more players into the community. And what was the developersâ response? Theyâve blown us off, refuse to comment, and only encourage those who have lost all respect for themselves and continue to pour money in [...] This cannot be tolerated.â 
Weâve reached out to Battlestate Games for comment and weâll update this story when we hear back. 
Update (April 26): In response to playersâ complaints concerning The Unheard Edition, Battlestate Games announced on Reddit that Edge of Darkness owners will receive some features. Beyond gameplay perks like the ability to skip daily quests for free, unique clothing and armbands, and the faster return on insured items, the developers promise owners will get access to the new offline PvE mode for six months, along with high-priority matching for the same length of time. 
While this expands the scope of who will be able to play the new mode, it hasnât quelled the ire from the community. Not only is it a temporary measure, but players who didnât buy any special editions are now concerned theyâll be waiting in queues for longer. Edge of Darkness owners are still calling for Battlestate to honor its promise to provide access to all DLC. 
Members of the Discord are still posting the aforementioned note and are also passing around a document that has instructions for reporting the U.K.-registered studio to the country for false advertising.",https://www.polygon.com/24140541/escape-from-tarkov-the-unheard-edition-250,2024-04-25 20:45:41
"BlizzCon 2024 canceled, but promised to come back âin future yearsâ","Blizzard Entertainment has canceled this yearâs fan convention BlizzCon, which was expected to be held in Anaheim, California in November. The company, which is now owned by Microsoft, announced the cancelation on Thursday, but promised to bring the event back âin future years.â
âAfter careful consideration over the last year, we at Blizzard have made the decision not to hold BlizzCon in 2024,â Blizzard posted to its website. âThis decision was not made lightly as BlizzCon remains a very special event for all of us, and we know many of you look forward to it. While weâre approaching this year differently and as we have explored different event formats in the past, rest assured that we are just as excited as ever to bring BlizzCon back in future years.â
Instead, Blizzard expects to announce details about its upcoming slate of games â like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo 4âs Vessel of Hatred expansion â later this year, on its own and at âother industry trade showsâ like Gamescom, which is scheduled for Aug. 21 to Aug. 24 in Cologne, Germany. Overwatch 2 esports are still on the schedule for Dreamhack Dallas and Dreamhack Stockholm, Blizzard wrote, while in-person World of Warcraft events will be hosted for the gameâs 30th anniversary. âWhile these events are distinct from BlizzCon, weâre harnessing all of our creativity and imagination to ensure that they carry the same spirit of celebration and togetherness,â Blizzard said.
This yearâs BlizzCon was expected to mark the second year in a row that the event would be held in-person after it was canceled in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The show went digital in 2021, and was canceled again in 2022. BlizzCon 2024 would also have been the first event since Microsoftâs $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard was finalized. That deal took 21 months to complete. Months later, Microsoft laid off 1,900 workers across its gaming divisions, which included heavy cuts to Activision Blizzard.
BlizzCon is typically Blizzardâs big, barn-burner event where the company announces its biggest games and updates. Blizzard does have the aforementioned World of Warcraft and Diablo 4 expansions this year, but there may not be a whole lot else after the developerâs untitled survival game was canceled alongside the layoffs. The survival game was announced in 2022 as âa vast realm of possibility, waiting to be exploredâ â and the studioâs first new franchise since Overwatch in 2016. The game was reportedly in development for six years before its cancelation, according to Bloomberg. Overwatch 2âs planned story mode, Hero Missions, was also canceled last year, with its Story Missions reportedly in jeopardy, too. That may leave little else to headline a show.
Blizzard fans are, understandably, upset about the eventâs cancelation. Beyond new game announcements, BlizzCon has also been a rare place for players â some of whom have played online together for years â to meet and gather.

"Wingspan publisherâs next board game is inspired by Zelda, Elden Ring, and The Witcher 3","Jamey Stegmaier, co-founder of Stonemaier Games, has made an indelible mark on board gaming since he entered the space in 2011. Not only has he designed and published incredible strategy games like Scythe and Viticulture, but he also helped produce and publish Elizabeth Hargraveâs genre-defining nature-themed board game Wingspan and its sequel. On Wednesday, he announced a secret project, the culmination of seven long years of work. Itâs called Vantage, and it might be one of the most exciting tabletop projects slated for 2025.
Stegmaier describes Vantage as an open-world, cooperative, roguelike science fiction-themed adventure game inspired by modern video games. In a recent livestream, he noted that the primary inspiration was the iconic The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but heâs also drawn in themes and mechanics from such disparate titles such as Elden Ring, A Short Hike, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
Players will take on the roles of explorers headed to an unknown extrasolar planet. A malfunction leads to a crash landing, scattering from one to six players all across the map. There are 100 landing sites in total which, together with 800 additional location cards, make up the unnamed planetâs singular, cohesive surface. Cards are organized in such a way that players can freely traverse the entire planet, moving vertically and horizontally across its surface in the style of The 7th Continent. 

    Related
  
The trick is that you canât show what you see to the other players at the table. Each player only has their own perspective â their own vantage point â and must communicate whatâs in front of them to the other players. 
To be successful, players must share as much as they can about the strange new world in front of them. Because of the roguelike nature of the game â which wipes your character, their skills, assets, and other abilities away when you fail to survive the experience â the only true measure of advancement is your own personal experience of the mysterious planet itself.
âThe only thing that persists from one game of Vantage to the next,â Stegmaier said, âis your information, your knowledge of this planet and how you might apply that to future games.â
The way that the game limits communication, combined with a huge number of cards in the box â more than 1,700 total, Stegmaier said â should make every journey unique.
âEven if you play the same character, and you happen to crash land in the same location as before, you can just go east instead of west,â Stegmaier said. âYou can go north instead of south. You can interact with that location in a different way than before. So thereâs a lot of replayability that Iâve baked into this game.â
âIt is not a campaign game,â Stegmaier stressed. âYou are playing until you win, or until you fail. [...] And then you start over from scratch.â
While the design has largely been completed, as well as most of the gameâs art, Stegmaier said that Vantage is currently in a blind playtesting phase. That means prototypes are being run through a gauntlet of players who have no idea what to expect when they open the box. Next comes graphic design and finalization of the materials inside the box â especially the manual that will help onboard new players. More information, including pricing and the final release date, will he shared in the months to come.

Uniqloâs Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is next video game collab,"Uniqloâs latest video game collaboration may be its best yet. Itâs teamed up with Nintendo on six T-shirts inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and theyâre available now. Each $24.90 T-shirt features iconography and characters from Tears of the Kingdom. Have a look at them below.

The quote âPlease lend him your powerâ adorns the front of this black T-shirt, with grey outlines of Link reaching for Princess Zelda. For context, in Tears of the Kingdom, Link is given strength (as well as several great Zonai abilities) thanks to Rauruâs arm, which was previously used to seal away the Demon King, Ganondorf. The back of the T-shirt features the key art from Tears of the Kingdom with Link perched on a collection of ruins in the sky.

There are a grand total of 1,000 Korok seeds scattered around and above Hyrule in Tears of the Kingdom. Some of these tiny, leafy dudes can be found under rocks, stuck in trees, or roasting on a spit. But, it would seem that three of them are attempting to avoid detection on this beige T-shirt, with one cleverly stashed in the breast pocket.

The aimless spirits of slain monsters have returned, printed on this blood orange-colored T-shirt. The Blood Moon rises over a Boss Bokoblin and its minions, and a quote from Zelda is scrawled at the bottom. 

                Prices taken at time of publishing.
              
Iâd say this is a spoiler, but itâs literally on the shirt: The Light Dragon is the keeper of the Master Sword in Tears of the Kingdom and can only be found by tracing twelve of its tears across Hyrule. The azure eyes of this elusive beast adorn the front of this white T-Shirt, complete with a Master Sword embedded in the center above some sage words of caution to all would-be adventurers.

Addison, everyoneâs favorite dorky try-hard, has been immortalized on this pocketed white T-shirt. Seen carrying his comically oversized sign across Hyrule in an attempt to impress his boss (if only he could get it to stand up), he seems to have made his way into this T-shirtâs breast pocket. An enlarged version of his sign can be found printed on the back of the shirt as well.

Dragonâs Dogma 2 patch reins in the disastrous Dragonsplague,"Capcom has released a patch update for Dragonâs Dogma 2 that tones down the threat from Dragonsplague, the viral sickness that can be caught â and carried from one playerâs game to another â by pawns, the gameâs AI-controlled party members.
Infected pawns show signs of sickness, become aggressive and disobedient, and their eyes glow red. Eventually, when the player rests at an inn, the pawn transforms into a shadowy dragon that can wipe out whole towns full of merchants and quest-givers. Since the player has just saved at the inn, thereâs no way to roll back the game save, either. (Towns apparently do repopulate over time, though.)
When waves of Dragonsplague started to hit in earnest after the gameâs release in March, some players were shocked and annoyed at the devastation being wrought on their game saves â despite the gameâs frequent warnings about the grave threat from the disease. It was another example of the apparently deliberate pushback against players in Dragonâs Dogma 2âs game design, like the lack of fast travel options, and the way saving is handled, making it hard to just roll back bad luck.
But it seems Capcom is now admitting that in this one instance, players may have had a point. In the patch notes for the new update, the developer notes that it has reduced the infection frequency of Dragonsplague and made the signs of infection easier to spot â for example, by making pawnsâ glowing eyes more noticeable.
pic.twitter.com/qrShwMMHEj
Is this a case of the developers capitulating to the loud complaints of a section of their fanbase and compromising their original vision, like the infamous debacle of Mass Effect 3âs ending? That may be part of it, but itâs also possible that Capcom genuinely didnât intend the scale of the wipeouts that the Dragonâs Dogma 2 community has been seeing.
The game has been a sales success â Capcom said it had sold 2.5 million copies in its first two weeks â and maybe the infection rate of Dragonsplague wasnât correctly tuned for an audience of this size. Also, while Capcom says it has made it easier to spot the signs of the disease, it makes no mention of toning down the consequences of letting it go unchecked, so unobservant players could still face NPC massacres in their games. The development team has yet to cede ground on any other systems that have been giving players grief, like the expense and scarcity of fast travel items. So the signs point to this is an intentional balance change.
Elsewhere in the patch, Capcom has taken a number of steps to make pawns, to put it bluntly, less annoying. Pawns will now fall off cliffs and repeat themselves less often, keep their chat on topic, actually guide the player when they offer to, and be more responsive to help commands when the player is being held by an enemy. 
Oh, and treasure chests that have already been acquired wonât be displayed on the minimap any more.

"Fallout is âprobably the best-performing Commander set ever,â says Hasbro CEO","Magic: The Gatheringâs recent set of Fallout-themed cards is the franchiseâs âbest-performing Commander set ever,â said Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks. The announcement, made Wednesday during an earnings call with investors, brings attention to the potential of the trading card gamesâ ambitious Universes Beyond initiative. But it also highlights the risks of working with intellectual property licensed from other companies.
Following successful experiments with The Walking Dead- and Godzilla-themed cards for Magic: The Gathering, the Universes Beyond initiative was formally launched in February 2021. The first batch of crossover cards included franchises like Warhammer 40,000 and Doctor Who. While all of those sets sold well, itâs the Lord of the Rings set that turned heads in the C-suite. It generated more than $200 million in revenue in less than six months, which is more than double the benchmark set by other historically high-performing sets, according to Hasbro. 
Now the Rhode Island-based company wants to produce two similarly sized sets each year. That means incurring some hefty expenses to license the best IP.
The Fallout cards, released in May, were well timed to benefit from the launch of the Fallout streaming television show on Amazon. But Cocks was quick to note that this wasnât a Lord of the Rings-sized win for Hasbro. 
âI would say Fallout has been a great set,â Cocks said. âItâs probably our best-performing Commander set ever, whether itâs a Universes Beyond set or not. However, Commander sets tend to be quite a bit smaller than our overall premier sets, so you have weight that accordingly.â 
The Commander format generates far less revenue for Hasbro than its âpremierâ sets â that is, the larger multiformat sets designed for multiple communities within its player base. Weighed against the cost of licensing Fallout from its owners at Bethesda, the Fallout set likely generated less revenue for the company compared to The Lord of the Rings. 
The next Universes Beyond release scheduled for 2024 is Assassinâs Creed, and a portion of the earnings from those cards will need to make their way to the IP owner, Ubisoft. The same is true of the next two Universes Beyond sets planned for 2025: Marvel (owned by Disney) and Final Fantasy (owned by Square Enix). 
Can any of those three sets compete with The Lord of the Rings? Cocks seems to think so, and his messaging to investors is that the revenue earned from selling those cards will outweigh the expense of licensing the IP â potentially to a greater extent than was the case with The Lord of the Rings.
âI think Final Fantasy and Marvel are going to be pretty significant sets,â Cocks said. âI would put them in the same league, at least, as what we saw with Lord of the Rings.â 
The reasons, according to Cocks, are clear: Marvel has a massive international fandom, and Hasbro has signed a multiset agreement with Disney, meaning it will have several bites at the apple. Final Fantasy, on the other hand, is likewise big in the U.S. and Europe, but itâs even bigger in Japan. 
âOur sales in Japan will probably dwarf what we did with Lord of the Rings,â Cocks said, âbecause of the resonance that [Final Fantasy] has in that market â which, you should remember, is the No. 2 market for Magic and the No. 2 market overall for trading card games.â
The cost of licensing IP puts an increased emphasis on the performance of Hasbroâs own cards created with its in-house IP. Those sets essentially have a lower overhead cost to produce. Cocks said he was still waiting to see how the companyâs latest in-house set, Outlaws of Thunder Junction, performs. The irony here is, of course, that at the same time that Hasbro is using licensed IP to bolster its game sales, itâs also hoping to license its own IP out for video games, movies, and other media projects.
âI think what youâre seeing in Q1 is kind of our overall strategic thesis playing out,â Cocks said, âthat Hasbro is a games, IP, and toy company, effectively, in that order.â
The trick will be making sure that Hasbro puts as much effort into its homemade IP as it can, thereby making it as attractive to other developers and publishers as possible.",https://www.polygon.com/24139124/mtg-fallout-best-selling-commander-set-ever,2024-04-24 15:42:27
âTikTok banâ gets signed into law â hereâs what happens next,"On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed an extensive, $95 billion national security package that sends financial aid to Taiwan, Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza. Tucked inside that bill is a piece of legislation the governmentâs been trying to pass for a while â a purported âTikTok ban.â Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controller Applications Act, the bill wonât exactly ban TikTok; instead, the goal is to force TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the popular app. The legislation signed by President Joe Biden on Wednesday will give ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. (Biden could extend the deadline by 90 days, too.)
Why was the TikTok legislation pushed under a national security bill? Lawmakersâ argument is that ByteDance has or could share TikTok user data with the Chinese government. The concern is over a Chinese law that requires Chinese companies to share user data with the country if thereâs a risk to the countryâs national security, despite little (but not zero) evidence that TikTok has done so. Currently, TikTok has more than 170 million American users, making it one of the most popular apps in the country.
The Senate approved the bipartisan foreign aid package in a 79-18 vote. This latest push to force ByteDanceâs divestiture comes just one month after the U.S. House of Representatives passed its own TikTok bill. A separate bill, the RESTRICT Act, was proposed last year in a move to ban or restrict TikTok, but it never gained enough support to move past a congressional hearing.
TikTok intends to fight the bill by filing a legal challenge, according to a company statement. The company has waged its own lobbying campaign over the past few months, warning its users that their freedom of speech was at risk should the bill pass. In March, TikTok sent push notifications to its U.S.-based users asking them to contact their representatives to prevent the âtotal ban of TikTok.â Thousands of TikTok users contacted House lawmakers, but those efforts â and TikTok chief executive officer Shou Chewâs appearance on Capitol Hill â ultimately failed to sway Congress.
Response to TikTok Ban Bill
In a TikTok, Chew responded by reaffirming the companyâs plan to fight the legislation. âMake no mistake, this is a ban â  a ban on TikTok, and a ban on you and your voice. Politicians may say otherwise, but donât get confused. Many who sponsored the bill admit a TikTok ban is the ultimate goal,â he said. âItâs obviously a disappointing moment but it does not need to be a defining one. Rest assured, we arenât going anywhere. We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts. The facts and the constitution are on our side, and we expect to prevail again.â
Despite the passage of the bill, TikTok wonât be immediately banned, and the app will remain accessible to U.S. users. The bill instead makes it illegal for a company with ties to foreign adversaries â e.g., China â to distribute an app through platforms like the Apple App Store. The hope by the U.S. government is that ByteDance will sell off TikTok to a U.S.-based owner; the bill gives the company 270 days, or roughly nine months, to do so. President Biden could extend the deadline once, by a maximum of 90 days.
ByteDance obviously doesnât want to sell its cash cow in TikTok, and the company has made it clear that itâll fight the legislation in court. But if all that fails, and ByteDance doesnât let go of TikTok, then the app would be banned for U.S. users.
The penalty laid out in the bill for violating the legislation is $5,000 multiplied by the number of U.S.-based users, meaning ByteDance would have to cut a hefty check of around $850 billion. If a marketplace like the App Store kept hosting the app, Apple would incur a $500 fine for each U.S. user.
TikTokâs potential legal challenge, too, could complicate the timeline. Notably, this is a longer time frame than the March bill that passed the House, which gave ByteDance six months â putting the deadline before the upcoming election.
An NBC News source told the outlet that the election was âdefinitelyâ a topic that was âconveniently addressedâ by the new nine-month window. The speculation there is that the longer timeline shields Congress and Biden from voter backlash this November. Ironically, many U.S. lawmakers use TikTok as a way to reach young voters.
Update: Added the TikTok with CEO Shou Chewâs official response. ",https://www.polygon.com/24139127/tiktok-ban-law-biden-timeline,2024-04-24 15:20:31
Haikyu!! is finally back with a new movie!!,"The Karasuno boysâ volleyball team is finally back in action â though instead of a new season of beloved sports anime Haikyu!!, weâre getting a movie highlighting one of the most anticipated manga moments: the legendary Dumpster Battle.
The show follows spunky Hinata, who like many sports anime protagonists is determined to become the best volleyball player. He joins his high school team â only to find out that he must work with his middle school rival Kageyama. Haikyu!! takes sports anime conventions and really dives into them, emphasizing some of the more complicated emotions about winning, losing, and everything in between. 
The latest arc of the show had the Karasuno team at nationals, up against some of the best teams theyâve ever faced. The movie will pick up right where the most recent season left off,  as the team faces their most high-stakes match yet. 
The Karasuno team is up against rival school Nekoma. The two teams enjoy a friendly competition, and the Nekoma characters are some of the seriesâ most beloved. Matches between the two teams are often called âDumpster Battles,â since their respective mascots (crows and cats) are animals found at garbage dumps. 
The most recent season of Haikyu!! came out in early 2020, and wrapped up the second half late rin the year. So itâs been some four years since we last saw the Karasuno boysâ volleyball team. Luckily we wonât need to wait for much longer, beacuse the movie hits North American theaters on May 31.
All four seasons of Haikyu!! are available to stream on Crunchyroll.

Roll20 coming directly to your Discord server,"Shepherding your online tabletop group for a game night is going to get a little bit easier. Popular virtual tabletop tool Roll20 is coming to Discord, integrating right into the chat and voice platform. So, instead of running Roll20 separately in a browser with some other voice client, you can start the activity from right inside Discord itself. 
It works the way youâd launch any other activity on Discord. After jumping on a call, you can click the little rocket ship to begin an activity (or join in an existing activity). From there, Roll20 will be one of the options.
âWe are thrilled to introduce Roll20 to a new audience through our collaboration with Discord,â said Riley Dutton, co-founder of Roll20. âWe know how many existing Roll20 users love Discord, and weâre excited to offer them an easier way to play!â 
If your Roll20 account and your Discord are under the same email, you can seamlessly log in. Otherwise, youâll have to sign in (or create a new account). Every member of your party will need to make a Roll20 account and be on the same voice call.
The first person who launches the activity is the one who picks which campaign to launch (so, they assume the role of the GM). Everyone else filters into a waiting room before the GM starts the game. If you need to leave at any point, when you come back youâll jump right back in right where you left off. 
Additionally, if thereâs something on the Roll20 website you want to fiddle with, you can seamlessly switch between the two experiences. Whatever you do on the browser will be reflected in the Discord activity and vice-versa. You can join via the activity and have another player join in the web application. But youâll need to all be on the same Discord call, as the video and voice call tools within Roll20 itself wonât link up to the Discord call. None of those tools are going away, but they wonât be available within the activity. All the features you might have within your Pro or Plus accounts will be available.
The Roll20 Discord integration will also showcase Jumpgate, the big overhaul of Roll20. Itâs specifically focused on improving performance, but will also tweak the user interface for a more streamlined experience. Jumpgate is still in testing, but it will eventually become the Roll20 default. Right now, though, itâs the version of Roll20 available in the beta Discord activity. 
The Discord integration will first be available to Roll20 Pro subscribers via an exclusive beta testing phase starting April 30, before it unveils to the general public later this year. It will be available on both the Discord app and browser, though not on mobile.

"Fallout 76 has seen a million players in a single day, and 5 million across the franchise","As expected following the launch of the highly-anticipated Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime, there has been an uptick of people playing the Fallout games. However, people arenât just going for the newest game in the series. Fallout 76. Fallout 4, which released in 2015, and even the very first Fallout have seen relatively huge jumps in player count on Steam.
Fallout 1, in particular, peaked at 2,352 players on Steam over the weekend. Thatâs a pittance compared to the top games on Steam, but that is a whopping 553.3% jump in concurrent players over the past month, according to SteamDB. Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition is seeing a similar jump, with around 6,700 concurrent players hopping in over the weekend (a 415.4% increase over the past 30 days). Steam Charts also confirms the success of both, adding that even the base Fallout 3 is seeing a big jump. Then thereâs Fallout: New Vegas, which was developed by Obsidian Entertainment rather than Bethesda. While I wouldnât recommend playing it unless you download a ton of mods, people are still checking it out, with a peak of over 19,000 players in the days following the showâs release.
Fallout 76, meanwhile, reached its all-time peak on Steam over the weekend, with over 39,000 concurrent players. Itâs unclear what the numbers look like on other platforms, but Bethesda acknowledged on X that there have been a lot of new players to the game.
It's incredible to see all the new players coming to Fallout. Welcome! We're happy to have you join the best community there is. pic.twitter.com/JNRQBIUQoM
The influx of players to the online multiplayer role-playing game isnât too surprising when you consider that Bethesda made Fallout 76 free to play across platforms, from April 11-18. It was also free for Amazon Prime subscribers this month. And if you wanted to live out your Vault 33 fantasy in-game, there were some TV show cosmetics to boot.  
However, the biggest success among the franchise goes to Fallout 4, which peaked at over 83.000 players over the weekend and is maintaining a steady concurrent player count, with around 61,000 at the time of this writing. That makes it the 20th most played game on the platform right now. 
Bethesda announced last week that it would finally be receiving its next-gen update later this month, with a bunch of new features for PC players, so that might explain the recent popularity. Itâs also the newest mainline Fallout game, so is arguably the easiest for new players if they want a more vanilla Fallout experience. 
Itâs more evidence that video game series adaptations can lead to increased sales for the original games. We saw this with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which hit a new record for concurrent players on Steam after the Netflix show debuted. The Last of Us franchise also saw a huge uptick in sales following the HBO adaptation.
If youâre not on the bandwagon just yet, Bethesda is continuing to push new players into its games, with sales across platforms. On Steam, you can get some big discounts, although if you have the money, the Fallout Franchise Bundle for 77% off â  so for just $51.56 (basically the cost of one main Fallout game at launch). Fallout 76, specifically, is also on sale for up to 80% off for the standard edition and 67% off for the deluxe edition. Basically, if you wanted to check out any Fallout game, you have some options.
Update (April 24): As the buzz from the Fallout TV show continues, Bethesda announced on X that Fallout 76 has welcomed over one million players in one day, and all Fallout games together saw almost five million players in a single day.
...and almost five million across all Fallout games in a single day!â¡
Over a week later, the effects of the Prime Video seriesâ launch havenât tailed off â far from it. On Steam, Fallout 4 sits firmly within the top 10 most played, peaking at over 164,000 concurrent players on Sunday, April 21.
Fallout 76, meanwhile, hit an all-time peak of 73,368 concurrent players on the same day â which is more than double the peak it reached upon its Steam release in April 2020. This canât all be explained away by Bethesdaâs free promotions, either, since the gameâs free-to-play offer has concluded and, while the game remains free to Prime Gaming members, that service offers Windows Store codes, not Steam. Not bad for a game that was as good as written off at launch.

Fortnite will allow you to mute its âconfrontationalâ emotes ,"Fortnite bullies are about to get their biggest nerf yet.
Developer Epic Games is giving Fortnite players more control over which emotes they see. A new update released on Tuesday allows players to mute a short list of animations that the developers said can be used by players in âconfrontationalâ ways â and will mute their appearance to random players by default. Players can now choose whether or not they see the following emotes in game: Laugh It Up, Take the L, Whipcrack, and Make It Plantain.  
The short list contains some of Fortniteâs more aggressive victory celebrations. As its name implies, the âWhipcrackâ emote snaps a whip at another player; âLaugh It Upâ makes a character heave with donkey-like brays of laughter. Now, players who choose to mute those emotes will see a player stand still with no sound.  
In Fortnite, players âknockâ an enemy before killing them, sending them crawling and rendering them vulnerable to antics or taunts. Sometimes, this can result in funny moments shared between friends, but it can also enable aggressive behavior where players spam these emotes at a stranger. Now, these new settings will help players control what they see while playing. 
A Fortnite blog described how to use the new feature. To change which emotes show while playing, players can go to the âSocial Privacyâ section of the settings menu and edit the âSee Confrontational Emotesâ setting. According to the blog post, the gameâs default setting will mute these emotes for strangers, but not for friends. So if you want to turn them off entirely, or if you want see them again, thatâs how you can go change your settings.

Why Nintendo wouldnât let Samus be in Fortnite,"Back in 2021, court documents released as part of Epic Gamesâ legal battle with Apple revealed that Epic had, at some point, planned to put Samus Aran in Fortnite. But a skin based on the futuristic bounty hunter from Nintendoâs Metroid series never materialized.
Given the documents also mentioned some already-released characters, including Kratos from God of War and Haloâs Master Chief, some speculated that Samus might have been intended to represent Nintendo alongside these PlayStation and Xbox mascots in Fortniteâs Gaming Legends Series. Kratos and the Chief were both added in late 2020.
Now, thanks to an interview with former Epic creative lead Donald Mustard in the Game File newsletter, we know why Samus never joined them.
âI wanted three things,â Mustard said of the three iconic characters. But Nintendo couldnât countenance its prized character appearing on rival systems. âThey got really hung up on their characters showing up on platforms that werenât their platforms. They would be thrilled to have Nintendo characters in Fortnite, but just only if itâs on their platform.â
Nintendoâs request for Switch exclusivity for Samus met a red line of Epicâs own, Mustard explained. âFor me and for all of Epic, weâre like, âThat is an absolute must. We want to make sure that Fortnite is the same experience, no matter what screen or device youâre playing on.ââ
For anyone familiar with the tight control Nintendo exerts over its prized properties, itâs not a surprising anecdote. But itâs notable that the company remains one of the few holdouts against Fortniteâs gigantic crossover marketing power. Epic has been able to overcome the misgivings of most of the rest of the entertainment business; this, after all, is now a game in which Spider-Man, Batman, Darth Vader, and John Wick can appear side by side.
For Mustard, this was the achievement of a long-held dream. âI wanted to create a place that was basically like being out in the backyard when you were a kid in the â80s, or playing with your toys on the playroom floor,â he told Game File. âThere was no one there saying, âWell, Spider-Manâs allowed to this, and Batmanâs only allowed to do this. And Barbie canât hang out with Spider-Man.â Iâm like, I want to create something where you can hang out with your friends and express yourself however you want.â
It turned out that the appeal of putting their characters in front of Fortniteâs tens of millions of active players was too strong to resist for most intellectual property owners. But not for Nintendo, which seems to take a rather old-fashioned view of this kind of cross-platform, metaversal marketing. Perhaps that puts the Kyoto-based company behind the times. But the intensity of the connection between Nintendoâs characters, its games, and its hardware is unrivaled anywhere else in the game industry, and the sales figures speak for themselves. So maybe itâs onto something after all.",https://www.polygon.com/24138083/samus-fortnite-skin-nintendo-refused,2024-04-23 13:24:53
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a late addition to Aprilâs Game Pass lineup,"Itâs the best time of the year: The Stanley Cup playoffs have begun! When youâre not watching hockey, you could also be playing hockey with NHL 24, which has just been confirmed as an Xbox Game Pass lineup addition. NHL 24 was made available to console subscribers on April 18, just two days before the playoffs began.
EA has also announced that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, its thoroughly enjoyable 2023 action-adventure sequel, is coming to the EA Play library â included in both PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate â on Thursday, April 25.
But if youâre not a Star Wars or hockey fan, thatâs OK â thereâs plenty more coming to Xbox Game Pass this month, like the anticipated medieval strategy game Manor Lords. Manor Lords launches into early access on April 26, and Xbox Game Pass PC subscribers will have access from the start. Intriguing indie game Harold Halibut is available, too.
Hereâs the full lineup of games coming to Xbox Game Pass through the rest of April:
Subscribers to Game Pass Core, which is basically the Xbox Live Gold replacement, will get access to Deep Rock Galactic, Superhot: Mind Control Delete, and Wreckfest.
Like any other month, Microsoft will pull a few games from the service. Six games are leaving on April 30:
Xbox Game Pass costs $10.99 a month, while PC Game Pass costs $9.99 a month. PC Game Pass includes EA Play access, which offers another 70 games on PC. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, at $16.99 per month, gives subscribers access to everything â the PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass libraries, EA Play on both console and PC â as well as access to online multiplayer. Xbox Game Pass Core (formerly called Xbox Live Gold) costs $9.99 per month or $59.99 per year.
Update (April 23): This article has been updated to reflect the late addition of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to the Game Pass lineup for the second half of April.

7 Days to Die is leaving early access after almost 12 years,"Since launching in 2013, the zombie survival game 7 Days to Die has been in early access, but thatâs about to change. Studio The Fun Pimps announced Monday that the game is finally getting its 1.0 release. 
This update was previously known as Alpha 22, although the plan was always for it to be 1.0. There will be an experimental release in May and a stable 1.0 launch in June, although no specific dates are available just yet. The game will also be launching on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X with the 1.0 version. 
âWhen we first set out to make 7 Days to Die, we never thought our game would bring this much interest or have this much success. This would not be possible without the continued support of our incredible community, who have stood buy us for over a decade,â studio co-founder Richard Huenink said in a YouTube video posted over the weekend. â7 Days is our teamâs greatest passion, and TFP will continue to make content and add new features and grow this franchise because itâs our favorite game too.â
The 7 Days to Die alpha launched in August 2013 after a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign, where the developers met each of their stretch goals. Players came for the Minecraft-esque voxel-based sandbox and stayed over countless updates. While the team still hasnât fulfilled many of its Kickstarter goals, thereâs a roadmap that shows three major updates, starting with âStormâs Brewing,â which will overhaul the gameâs weather system. Even the 1.0 update will bring major changes, including new vehicles. 
While the console versions wonât ship with features like crossplay, an FAQ posted to explain the update news shares that the team hopes itâll be ready by the first big update. However, do note that saves will not carry over from the legacy version. 
To coincide with the news, Huenink also announced 7 Days to Die would receive a price increase to $44.99. This will not only standardize the pricing across both PC and console, but reflects the work the developers have put into the game over the past decade or so.
âWe feel as though the quality standard of the game has gone up significantly from when the initial price was set over 8 years ago along with over a decade of content and improvements. Weâve looked at how others have handled leaving early access, and this is a common practice,â the FAQ read. Current PC owners wonât have to pay extra for the 1.0 release, and new players can get the game on sale starting today until April 29. At the time of writing, 7 Ways to Die costs only $5.99 on Steam. 
Things will be a bit more complicated for console players. Those who own the legacy edition will have to purchase a new copy, although the studio is working with Sony and Microsoft to potentially offer discounts on the new version.

Everybody wants to talk about Cassandra Nova,"The first full trailer for Deadpool & Wolverine was released Monday, giving fans a good look at Hugh Jackman in the classic yellow suit, a good look at his banter with Ryan Reynoldsâ Deadpool, and a good look at Emma Corrin (The Crown) as the movieâs villain, Cassandra Nova. 
Nova cuts a dashing figure in an ankle-length trenchcoat and a strikingly bald head ripped straight from X-Men comics. And well she should â the X-Men villain is having a bit of a moment. 
Sheâs Professor Xâs evil twin. OK, thatâs a simplification. 
Sheâs Professor Xâs stillborn twin. She attempted to kill him in the womb and he overpowered her instead. But given that she had the same psychic aptitude as her brother, her consciousness remained. After several decades of trying, she managed to make her own physical form â just as bald and old as Charles, but a lady â and menaced the X-Men as a powerful psychic who seeks to kill Professor X and undo all of his achievements.
Thatâs also a simplification, but itâs really all you need to know. Trust me. 
Cassandra Nova debuted in E is for Extinction parts 1 and 2, the first two issues of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitelyâs New X-Men. In those issues, she brought an army of âWild Sentinelsâ to the mutant nation of Genosha, slaughtering 16 million mutants in a single day. 
Itâs those two ideas â Nova as an evil Professor X and her Genoshan genocide â that have everyone talking about her this spring. 
Over in the realm of animation, Disney Plusâ X-Men â97 made a whole episode out of the fall of Genosha, and has yet to reveal the mastermind behind it. Thereâs no guarantee that Cassandra Nova will show up (as of now, signs still point to Mister Sinister), but thereâs no doubt the folks behind â97 knew her name would come up in discussion. Even though she didnât even exist when the original X-Men animated series was produced, the episode is unavoidably referential to Novaâs comics appearance. 
In Deadpool & Wolverine, Nova appears to be ruling a wasteland world built of various Marvel movie properties, including a 20th Century Fox logo sunken into the sand and an enlarged Ant-Man helmet (complete with desiccated skull interior) as a headquarters. And thatâs potentially connected up with this version of Wolverine, who âlet down his entire world,â Ã  la Old Man Logan. 
While we may not know exactly how she fits in, or what sheâs doing â at least not until Deadpool & Wolverine hits theaters in July and X-Men â97 shows its hand â itâs proving to be a hot Cassandra Nova summer in the world of X-Men adaptations.",https://www.polygon.com/24137153/deadpool-wolverine-cassandra-nova-x-for-extinction,2024-04-22 17:20:00
LittleBigPlanet 3 nukes servers and library of player creations,"LittleBigPlanet 3âs servers have been offline since January, leaving players unable to access player-created levels stored in the gameâs archive. On Friday, developer Sumo Digital and publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment announced the servers will stay offline indefinitely âdue to ongoing technical issues.â 
LittleBigPlanet 3 players can still play offline, with access to the campaign and user-generated creations already downloaded to their PlayStation 4 consoles. Players can still create levels, too, but wonât be able to share them. That means more than 16 years of player creations have been wiped for the majority of LittleBigPlanet 3 players â though LittleBigPlanet 3 was released in 2014, players had access to creations all the way back to LittleBigPlanet.
âWe obviously share todayâs news with very heavy hearts and thank you for your continued support over the years,â a LittleBigPlanet 3 representative posted from the official X account.
LittleBigPlanet 3 was released in 2014, a follow-up to 2011âs LittleBigPlanet 2 and the original LittleBigPlanet from 2008. The game itself is beloved for its creative, playful platforming campaign â but itâs user-created content is whatâs given the game such an impressive lifespan. Problems began for LittleBigPlanet 3 in 2021, when servers were maliciously attacked. LittleBigPlanet 3 was eventually nixed for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, but came back online for PlayStation 4. Problems arose again in January, which led to the latest shutdown, which was supposed to be temporary.
Itâs not a unique thing for older games to go offline, which can be a significant preservation problem for video games and video game history. LittleBigPlanet 3âs big problem is its lack of notice for the permanent shutdown; usually, when these types of announcements are made, thereâs some time for players to say their goodbyes â whether thatâs saving favorite levels or simply having one last go at the game. Nintendo did this in 2020 when it announced Super Mario Maker would lose support for online features, giving players until 2021 to upload new courses. Those levels â and all others â remained available to download until April 2024, when online services for the Wii U went offline. Itâs still not ideal, but it gave players a chance to prepare.
LittleBigPlanet 3 players never had that chance. Thankfully, thereâs still the LittleBigArchive, where players have spent years documenting their work. But players arenât happy. âThis is probably the worst way for the servers to have been shut down,â LittleBigPlanet 3 creator EpicLBPTime wrote on X. âFor me and most of the community, we never got a chance to archive our levels. There was no warning or end date given. We were never given the opportunity to join up with our friends and play our favourite levels for the last time.â
They continued:
This really hurts. LittleBigPlanet played a significant role in my life, shaping who I am today. Itâs the reason I started my YouTube channel.
In the end, Iâm glad the servers lasted as long as they did. Thanks LBP for all the joy and happiness youâve brought me throughout the years. Iâm grateful to have experienced it and will cherish those moments forever ",https://www.polygon.com/24137118/littlebigplanet-3-servers-offline-2024,2024-04-22 16:18:22
Tales of the Shire trailer reveals a cozy Hobbit life sim game,"Lord of the Rings fans wonât have to wait too long for their next journey to the Shire. 
Private Division and WÄtÄ Workshop revealed a full trailer for Tales of the Shire on Monday, showcasing new details of the âcosy Hobbit lifeâ game. In a news release, the companies said that Tales of the Shire is expected to launch in the second half of 2024 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X, according to a news release.
The trailer shows life in the Shire, full of Hobbit friends, farming, home decoration, exploration, and plenty more. It looks a lot like Animal Crossing: New Horizons or Disney Dreamlight Valley, but make it Lord of the Rings. Tales of the Shire is set in Middle-earthâs Bywater, where the end goal is to bring the community closer with the biggest, bestest Bywater Festival. With its license from Middle-earth Enterprises, WÄtÄ Workshop Game Studio said, the developer has âthe broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the booksâ for the video game.
Hereâs how the studio describes it:
Create and personalise a Hobbit with an array of customisations to experience the world of J.R.R. Tolkienâs beloved Middle-earth universe your own way. Settle in and decorate a cosy Hobbit home, choosing from an array of furniture and home dÃ©cor to create your unique, humble abode. Then head outdoors to Bywater for plenty of cooking, fishing, foraging, gardening, and more relaxing activities in the Shire. Toss your lure to catch trout from the glistening waters of Bywater Pool, gather wild mushrooms, and then use the collected ingredients to bake a succulent pie to serve for luncheon. With a full belly, stroll back outside to explore the Shire and build relationships with the Bywater locals by helping them to build a garden, sharing one of the many daily Hobbit meals, and more.
Announced last fall, Tales of the Shire is a collaboration between Private Division and WÄtÄ Workshopâs new in-house video games division, WÄtÄ Workshop Game Studio. Itâs one of five upcoming Lord of the Rings games that Lord of the Rings rights-holder Embracer Group announced in 2023. Embracer has been hard at work downsizing and restructuring following the breakdown of a $2 billion deal, but Tales of the Shire seems to still be on track for its 2024 release. 
On Monday, ahead of the leaked trailer, Embracer Group announced it was continuing its overhaul by breaking the company into three separate entities: Asmodee Group, for tabletop; Coffee Stain & Friends, for indie games; and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends, for its Lord of the Rings titles and other AAA experiences.

Take-Two wins lawsuit over LeBron Jamesâ tattoos,"A jury voted unanimously on Friday in favor of Take-Two Interactive Software and rejected tattoo artist Jimmy Haydenâs claims that the video game maker violated copyrights when recreating Los Angeles Lakers supersatar LeBron James in its NBA 2K series. After a week in Ohio court, the jury determined Take-Two has an implied license to recreate Jamesâ tattoos, something that was extended to the game maker from Jamesâ agreement with the company.
Hayden first sued Take-Two in 2017 over the use of several tattoos he made for James that were reproduced in NBA 2K games from 2016 to 2020.
Take-Two attorney Dale Cendali said the company is âgratifiedâ for the verdict. She continued: âThe decision is an important decision for the entertainment industry. It is also an important decision for anyone who has ever gotten a tattoo and might have otherwise worried about their freedom to share their bodies with their tattoos. And it is a good development for tattoo artists as a contrary verdict could have discouraged people from getting tattoos at a time when the art form is flourishing.â Haydenâs lawyers have not responded to Polygonâs request for comment.
Hayden was originally suing over six tattoos he created for James, but U.S. District Judge Christopher Boyko ruled against the artist in early 2024, saying Hayden could only sue over two of those six tattoos: a tattoo of stars, and another of Jamesâ motherâs name, Gloria.
The jury trial began Monday with opening arguments, where Haydenâs attorney Todd Tucker said Take-Two âpainstakingly copiedâ Haydenâs work for the game, according to local news outlet Cleveland.com. Alongside opening arguments, jurors watched clips of NBA 2K games featuring James. James did not appear in court, but Take-Twoâs lawyers intended to play his recorded deposition for the jury. Take-Two also called on game designer and Play Anything author Ian Bogost as a witness, according to court documents.
Tucker told jurors that Hayden has been compensated for the use of his tattoos â even on James â by other companies, like Warner Bros. with Space Jam 2. He got $1,500 for that use, Tucker said.
For Take-Two, attorney Dale Cendali said that Hayden got paid only after filing the lawsuit, and that Jamesâ tattoos are a very small part of NBA 2K. Cendali said James licensed his own likeness to Take-Two through the NBA Players Association â a ruling in Haydenâs favor would mean James would have to ask Hayden permission to license his very own being, as reported by Cleveland.com.
âTake-Two didnât need permission because Mr. James already gave Take-Two permission,â Cendali said. âThatâs exactly what this case is about. The whole point is Mr. Jamesâ ability to license his likeness. This case affects Mr. James much more than Take-Two.â
The issue at stake is whether a tattoo artist can copyright art theyâve given an âimplied licenseâ â i.e., putting something permanently on someoneâs body. Sure, a sketch or design  may be able to be copyrighted, but once itâs on another person, whose is it? For Haydenâs side, itâs a trademark issue, but Take-Two says a win in Haydenâs favor makes this a serious issue of ownership of licensing oneâs likeness. Itâs an issue that video game companies and tattoo artists have been litigating for years â and thereâs still no real legal consensus.
This isnât the first time a video game company has been sued over an athleteâs tattoos â not even the first time for Take-Two. A company called Solid Oak Sketches sued Take-Two in 2016 over Jamesâ tattoos, as well as tattoos on Kobe Bryant, DeAndre Jordan, Eric Bledsoe, and Kenyon Martin. Solid Oak Sketches said it had licensing agreements for the tattoos. Take-Two won that lawsuit in 2020 after a judge declared the tattoos fair use. On the flip side, Take-Two lost a lawsuit in 2022 filed by tattoo artist Catherine Alexander, who inked five tattoos on WWE wrestler Randy Orton. She filed in 2018 after those designs showed up on Orton in WWE 2K games and ultimately received $3,750 in damages â not a huge win, but up from the $450 she said WWE originally (and unsuccessfully) offered her for licensing.
Hayden, the tattoo artist from this case, has another lawsuit ongoing with Take-Two over the use of tattoos on James, Danny Green, and Tristan Thompson in NBA 2K21; that lawsuit was on hold until a decision was made in the ongoing court battle.
In 2012, a tattoo artist sued Electronic Arts over a tattoo on NFL running back Ricky Williamsâ arms after they were reproduced in NFL Street. In 2013, another tattoo artist sued THQ over UFC Undisputed 3, in which a tattoo from artist Christopher Escobedoâs work appears on fighter Carlos Condit. Both lawsuits were dismissed, and Conditâs tattoos were removed from the UFC game.
Update: This story has been updated to reflect the juryâs decision in favor of Take-Two Interactive Software.",https://www.polygon.com/24131877/nba-2k-lebron-james-tattoo-jury-trial-april-2024,2024-04-19 21:59:06
Yuri!!! on Ice movie canceled after 7 years in production,"The long gestating Yuri!!! on Ice movie has officially been canceled. The movie was announced back in 2017, though news on the production front has been scant since. After a short teaser in 2018 and a note in 2020, the production team finally announced the cancelation on X this Friday.

Thank you very much for always supporting Yuri!!! On Ice.
Regarding the postponed release of Yuri!!! On Ice the movie: Ice Adolescence, we have tome to the decision to unfortunately cancel its production.
We deeply apologize for not being able to meet the expectations of all those who have been waiting and have continued to support us throughout these yers.
The production committee and staff have been in constant discussions to create and to deliver the movie, but due to various circumstances, we have had to make the difficult decision to stop production.
We sincerely apologize to everyone who has been anticipating gets release and thank you once again for your continued support. 
Yuri!!! on Ice premiered in 2016 and ran for 12 episodes. It follows Yuri Katsuki, the titular anxious figure skater (and also winner of Polygonâs inaugural Who Would Win Week bracket in 2022), in his quest to win the Figure Skating Grand Prix. After a devastating loss, Yuri initially retires, but when his figure skating idol, the talented and very handsome Victor Nikiforov, shows up at his door and offers to be his coach, Yuri takes a chance. Along the way, romantic feelings blossom between the two. 
The movie was supposedly going to highlight Victorâs teenage years. The anime never really dove into his backstory, but it was pretty clear that his adolescence was full of hard training. Heâs totally chill with leaving everything behind to follow Yuri, so there must not have been a lot keeping him in Russia.
But with the movie officially canceled, any glimpses into Victorâs past will have to come from theories. Weâll always have fanfiction â and the official illustration released by the production team in 2022, where Yuri and Viktor are tenderly sitting together on the sidelines of a competition.

The Witcher season 5 on Netflix will be the seriesâ last,"Netflix announced today that Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri will return for a fifth season of The Witcher â and that the showâs fifth season will be its last. Season 5 will be filmed back-to-back with season 4, which has just started production.
The announcement came with the first official hints at the plot of season 4, which sees Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri separated and attempting to find one another across a dangerous and conflict-strewn Continent.
âAfter the shocking, Continent-altering events that close out season three,â says Netflixâs official summary, âthe new season follows Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri who are faced with traversing the war-ravaged Continent and its many demons apart from each other. If they can embrace and lead the groups of misfits they find themselves in, they have a chance of surviving the baptism of fire and finding one another again.â
The âbaptism of fireâ line in Netflixâs announcement seems like a clear Easter egg for fans suggesting season 4 will primarily follow the book Baptism of Fire, which is the fifth book in Andrzej Sapkowskiâs Witcher series. One thing that isnât clear is if season 4 will reach beyond the fifth book, considering the show has three books left to adapt and only two seasons left to cover that ground. However itâs divided between seasons 4 and 5, the show will eventually make it through the events of The Tower of the Swallow and Lady of the Lake to finish out Sapkowskiâs series, according to Netflixâs release.
The streaming giant also revealed footage and photos of the production reuniting for the first table read of The Witcher season 4, featuring returning cast members and new addition Liam Hemsworth. Season 4 will be the first season of The Witcher to feature Hemsworth in the role of Geralt, following Henry Cavillâs departure from the series. 
We're heading back to The Continent. The Witcher Season 4 is officially in production. And Season 5 is coming to bring this epic series to a fitting conclusion. pic.twitter.com/mejYbhfhxZ
Netflix did not announce a release window for either new season, but with production on the two seasons just getting under way, it seems safe to assume we wonât see The Witcher season 4 until 2025. 
While a noted Witcher superfan, Cavill stepped away from the series in October 2022, with Hemsworth (The Hunger Games franchise, Independence Day: Resurgence) tapped to replace him. Cavill had just announced his return to the role of Superman, and at the time many assumed that heâd left The Witcher to have time for Warner Bros.â superhero franchise. 
But in December of that year, James Gunn announced that the first Superman film of Warner Bros.â new plans for DC Comics-based films would focus on a younger Superman not played by Cavill. And in the same week, Cavill announced that heâd entered into a deal with another franchise very close to his heart: the Warhammer 40k universe. Cavill is set to star in and executive produce a Warhammer âcinematic universeâ of âfilm, television, and more.â

Cities: Skylines 2 devs apologize for state of game: âWe let you downâ,"Months after release, Cities: Skylines 2 developers Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive have issued an apology over the poor state of the game and its recent DLC, Beach Properties, along with the lack of updates to address player concerns about performance and the lack of content. 
âWe see and understand the disappointment many of you have expressed after the release of Cities: Skylines II and the recent release of Beach Properties. We asked for your patience and support, and youâve shown those. In return, we let you down. We thought we could make up for the shortcomings of the game in a timeframe that was unrealistic, and rushed out a DLC that should not have been published in its current form. For all this, we are truly sorry,â Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen and Paradox Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja said in a joint statement published it to the Paradox forum on Thursday.
In response, the developers will be issuing refunds for people who bought Beach Properties, and will change the pack to free DLC. Ultimate Edition players wonât receive refunds, but theyâll get three additional creator packs and three radio stations. 
Cities: Skylines 2 launched in October 2023, and at the time of writing, it has over 2,300 âmostly negativeâ recent reviews on Steam, with most of the critiques noting poor PC performance. IGN reports that just after release, players noted how the game struggled to play on PCs even with powerful specs, such as those with recent Nvidia graphics cards. When recommended specs were revealed ahead of launch, it also raised a lot of questions from players. While Cities: Skylines has always been a power-hungry game, encouraging players to only play it on PCs with newer parts was asking a lot. 
Despite the player feedback, Colossal Order and Paradox moved forward with the release. âWe still think for the long-term of the project, releasing now is the best way forward. We are proud of the unique gameplay and features in Cities: Skylines II, and we genuinely believe that it offers a great experience that you will enjoy,â a forum post read shortly before the gameâs release.
While Colossal Order released weekly patches until November, it was then announced that the studio would still be working on performance improvements and bug fixes but would be moving its focus towards DLC. The Beach Properties paid DLC released in March, bringing waterfront zoning to the game, and it was met with harsh feedback from the player base. It has an âoverwhelmingly negativeâ rating on Steam right now, with players noting the lack of meaningful additions and commenting that the developers should have focused on fixing the main game before starting on paid expansions. The new statement seems to address those concerns. 
âLooking ahead, we also want to make immediate and meaningful changes in the way we approach the gameâs development and our communication with you,â the statement reads. âWe will focus on additional free patches and game updates in the coming months before Colossal Order spends time on new paid content,â adding that the Bridge and Ports expansion has been delayed to 2025. 
Development issues also led to the console editions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X getting pushed to spring 2024, and the new statement announced that the delay has been extended to October 2024.

Pathfinder is having a big year with War of Immortals,"Paizo, fresh off a highly-anticipated refresh of Pathfinderâs 2nd edition ruleset, announced some big moves for the gameâs ongoing narrative on Tuesday. The War of Immortals meta-event will kill a god, span multiple rulebooks, and restart the publisherâs line of hardcover novels. It will also introduce the first two original classes built following the companyâs formal departure from the legacy Dungeons & Dragons ruleset and the OGL.
At the center of the new narrative arc will be Pathfinder War of Immortals, a 240-page hardcover rulebook expected in October that will introduce âmythic rulesâ for Pathfinder Second Edition. These rules should function similarly to past mythic-tier content, which represented ways to make your high-level characters stand out with powerful boons and abilities. According to a news release, the book will also include two new character classes â the animist and the exemplar â which are âthe first original classes built on the remastered foundation of Pathfinder Player Core.â

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
(Pathfinder Player Core and Pathfinder GM Core were released in November 2023. The team moved the game off of Wizards of the Coastâs Open Game License (also known as the OGL), which had allowed the original version of Pathfinder Second Edition to use some legacy materials from D&D, following Wizardsâ attempts to change that agreement. Paizo now publishes its fantasy TTRPG under its own license, called the Open RPG Creative (ORC) License. You can read more about that transition in Polygonâs interview with publisher Eric Mona.)
Next, Pathfinder Lost Omens: Divine Mysteries is a setting book with a smattering of character options â not unlike Pathfinder Lost Omens: Tian Xia World Guide detailed here at Polygon in March. Instead of a guide to an entire region, however, this 320-page hardcover will include a remastered pantheon of deities. It will also feature new deities, such as Aleph, god of darkness, and Nin, god of vampires. The $79.99 book is expected in November.

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
Several new adventures are included in the War of Immortals arc. Pathfinder Adventure: Prey for Death is a standalone 128-page adventure for high-level characters (level 14 and above). Expect the larger-than-usual, hardcover format to make a splash when it is released at Gen Con on Aug. 1, 2024. 

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
Two even larger campaigns are also on the docket. 
Pathfinder Adventure Path: Curtain Call â Pathfinderâs 40th since its launch in 2009 â will take characters from level 11 all the way to 20. The episodic release will begin at Gen Con with Pathfinder Adventure Path #204: Stage Fright and will conclude in September. Pathfinder Adventure Path: Triumph of the Tusk, which has players fighting alongside a band of orcs, will pick up in October with Pathfinder Adventure Path #207: The Resurrection Flood and continue into December.
Both Adventure Paths are included in their entirety as part of the Pathfinder Adventure Path Subscription.
Finally, a new novel titled Pathfinder: Godsrain, written by Liane Merciel, is also due out in November. Paizo said in its news release that the book will follow âfour iconic heroes â the wizard Ezren, the barbarian Amiri, the cleric Kyra, and her wife, the rogue Merisiel â as they witness the calamity of the Godsrain and are faced with the opportunities â and consequences â of mythic power.â

PokÃ©mon Go players think new customization update makes trainers âuglyâ,"Niantic Labs released a PokÃ©mon Go update on Wednesday that claimed to make trainers look âeven moreâ like the players themselves â and players are now starting to see that comment as a roast. Thatâs because a loud group of players on social media thinks the update made trainers âugly.â And, uh, yeah... thereâs something off about the new trainer avatars.
The update was intended to give PokÃ©mon Go a fresh coat of paint â âin-game map, encounter screens, battle screens, and more,â according to Niantic. The avatars got a makeover, too, with the game giving players new options for body types, hairstyles, and skin tones. Itâs a great thing to give players more options, like using fat bodies, but the implementation went wrong somewhere. Proportions are off across the board, and faces now look lifeless. Arms are too long, hands are too big, and the skin tones just donât look quite right.

He looks so sad now. The light gone from his eyes, the healthy glow taken from his skin. pic.twitter.com/d7iRO5KOy2
Players are reporting broken or missing cosmetic options and emotes, too â some of which people paid real money for. Thatâs a problem in and of itself, but the fervor around the update goes beyond financial investment. Digital avatars are personal, intimate; people across games spend a lot of time nailing the details to present themselves just right. The new update was supposed to give a wider range of people the delight of perfecting their PokÃ©mon Go trainers, but has instead upset what feels like the entire playerbase.
Niantic released new avatar customization for Pokemon Go and players are upset. #gamingontiktok #pokemongo #pokemon 
The problem for PokÃ©mon Go players isnât that there are expanded options, but that they arenât implemented correctly. Players are campaigning for Niantic to revert the update until the issues can be fixed â similar in nature to the backlash to Sonic the Hedgehogâs movie redesign. Niantic hasnât responded publicly, nor to Polygonâs request for comment. Weâll update this story when they do.

M. Night Shyamalan is getting so good that even his new trailers have twists,"M. Night Shyamalan has long been known for his twists, but those twists are normally reserved for the ends of his movies, not the trailers. But it seems like heâs branching out into unexplored territory with his new thriller Trap, which has a first trailer that feels worthy of the Shyamalan name. 
The trailer starts out with a daughter (Ariel Donoghue) rushing her father (Josh Hartnett) into a stadium where his favorite pop star (played by M. Nightâs daughter Saleka Shyamalan) is about to perform. The concert has all the hallmarks and visual signifiers of an Eras-style mega-tour. But when the dad takes a break from the singing to go to the bathroom, he suddenly notices that cops and S.W.A.T. teams have the entrances to the building locked down, and things start to spiral into some very surprising directions. But youâll have to watch the trailer to get the full effect.
In M. Nightâs presentation of the trailer at CinemaCon 2024, he said he developed the idea for the movie over several years with his daughter Saleka, who is a real-life R&B singer. Over the years, M. Night and Saleka frequently discussed how to combine their love of music and thrillers into one movie, and Trap finally helped them hit on just the right idea. 
Of course, even with all the details that the trailer gives away, itâs likely that there are plenty more surprises in store for the rest of Trap â after all, M. Night wouldnât give up his only twist in the trailer. But weâll have to wait until Trap hits theaters on Aug. 9 for the full story.

Disney Plus is adding channels as streaming inches ever closer back to cable,"Streaming is taking yet another step toward cable. Just weeks after combining its Hulu and Disney Plus services, Disney Plus is adding streaming channels, according to a report from The Information. This marks the latest push toward the old model of TV-watching from one of the worldâs biggest streaming companies, and while that may sound like a step backwards, itâs probably a good thing in the long run. 
Disney Plusâ new feature will reportedly include separate channels for different types of content. This seems likely to include things like a Marvel channel, a Star Wars channel, and maybe even something collecting the animated works from both Pixar and Disney. The channels would run 24/7, and would include content curated by Disney, which users could jump straight into whenever they log into the service.
This idea â basically cable channels for streaming services â isnât a Disney Plus invention. Other services like Shudder, Peacock, and Pluto have been doing it for years, and the Criterion Channel just started its channel last week. In every case, the channels are met with universal acclaim. While streaming has certainly proven that people have an appetite for choosing their own content, anyone who has stared at Netflixâs homepage for an hour just to close it and do something else instead knows that endless options arenât always best. In fact, most people love to stumble on something new they might not have chosen to watch themselves, or an old favorite they forgot they loved. 
Meanwhile, the appeal of channels is obvious for the services themselves, too. It lets them shine lights on the less-viewed titles in their catalog, or direct viewersâ attention to a movie or TV series they might never have considered otherwise. On top of that, in the most old-world cable way possible, 24/7 channels are a haven for advertisements, something that more and more streaming services are introducing as they discover that the profitability of the subscription-only model is questionable at best. 
Combine all that with the increase in service bundling â one reduced subscription rate for several services â and suddenly the whole business of watching things at home is starting to look a whole lot like the cable model the industry moved away from in the late 2010s. Maybe part of the reason both companies and viewers are slowly coming back to that era is that it wasnât quite as bad as everyone thought, it just took seeing the alternatives for everyone to realize how good we had it. More importantly, if all the streaming era accomplished is putting a dent in the cable monopolies that dominated the 1990s and 2000s, it will all have been worth it.

An explosive episode of Critical Role kept viewers hooked for 5 horrifying hours,"Typically, the live viewership for Critical Role dips after its break around midnight Eastern, as a good chunk of the audience heads to bed with plans to catch the rest of the Dungeons & Dragons actual-play episode later on. But last weekâs session was so suspenseful that viewer numbers continued to climb until the very end. The marathon five-hour broadcast was must-watch TV for dedicated fans thanks to the return of a past adversary and a bold player move that felt as if it had been pulled from a different game entirely â because it was.
[Warning: This story contains spoilers for episode 91 of Critical Roleâs Campaign 3, âTrue Heroism.â The video on demand is now available on YouTube, with audio-only podcast available on Thursday, April 18.]
For those of you who havenât been keeping up with Bellâs Hells, the unlikely heroes at the center of Critical Roleâs third campaign, itâs important to realize that just about every member of the party is a ticking time bomb â some more so than others. One entered the campaign bound to Vox Machinaâs nemesis Delilah Briarwood. Two were born under Exandriaâs red moon of ill omen. Two have absorbed shards of primordial power that nearly killed them. One has made a deal with a hag. And one rolls every day to see if he died in the night.  
And then thereâs Fresh Cut Grass, an automaton played by Sam Riegel. Normally heâs a healer with a sunny disposition, but under stress he gets a tad violent. How violent? Well, they killed everyone in his previous adventuring party, and even attacked the Bellâs Hells at one point in the not-too-distant past. But their path toward understanding the meaning of existence has revealed he has the ability to love, which is handy. Also? Thereâs literally a bomb lodged inside his chest.
Last week, at the end of the episode, that bomb went off â and that was just the final twist in a night full of wild turns. 
While on a reconnaissance mission to Ruidus, the party ran into their longtime nemesis Otohan Thull, who nearly killed the entire party early in the campaign as well as attacking several of their mentors. The encounter started hot, as Otohan killed a character outright in her first turn. While clever maneuvering removed a significant additional source of her power, she was still formidable â and when damaged enough, she shifted to an Exaltant form that began taking only half damage from all sources. As the fight dragged on and on, many characters were down or barely able to stand. Making matters worse, the partyâs resources, including spell slots, were very drained â just as Otohan was able to heal an astronomical amount of damage. Even Dungeon Master Matt Mercer seemed aware of the possibility that they could all die. âSometimes itâs the end of the story,â Mercer said with wry encouragement, framing such a possibility to his frantic players as âopportunities.â 
But Mercer was not prepared for what his players did next. Multiple characters were ready to die to save the party as a whole, but in the end it was Fresh Cut Grass who took the opportunity. When his turn came in the initiative order, he cast Guiding Bolt at himself, setting off the bomb within. Mercer made it clear that Fresh Cut Grassâ move was not something that they had previously discussed or designed, repeatedly checking in with Riegel to ensure he knew the gravity of what he was doing, before calling for the table to pool their dice for Riegel to roll the improvised blast damage.
But this wasnât entirely improvisation â it was clearly inspired by Daggerheart, the new game the company is designing to facilitate Critical Roleâs style of play, currently in open beta. As they came to realize what Riegel was doing, the table used the phrase âBlaze of Gloryâ multiple times as Riegel confirmed, âIâm Blaze of Glory-ing.â This was a reference to the death mechanics in Daggerheart, where players can choose one of three options: âAvoid Death,â which ensures survival but comes with a potential cost; âRisk It All,â where the dice control the characterâs fate; or âBlaze of Glory,â where GM and player work together to âensure that the one action they take is as meaningful as possible without breaking the integrity of the story.â The current playtest specifically mentions the possibility that the character âcan deal a fatal blow to the foe, even if they had more HP left than a critical success could possibly deal.â Fresh Cut Grass did just that, leaving a smoking crater where one of their greatest enemies once stood.
The episode was a reminder of Critical Role at its strongest, where game mechanics provide meaningful constraints, the dice throw narrative expectations out the window, players rise to the occasion in surprising ways, and the DM deftly calibrates to reward gutsy choices. It is notable that both tears and smiles were present at the table â a real sense of loss, but also palpable joy at a story well told together. While Daggerheart is still in the process of open beta (and thus subject to many changes), itâs clear that thereâs a real power in a Blaze of Glory, for both players and an audience.
Itâs not clear what lies ahead for either Bellâs Hells or Daggerheart, but last weekâs episode showed that thereâs reason to hope â and to keep an eye on both.

First Transformers One trailer shows Optimus Prime and Megatron as best buds,"The animated origin story of Autobot leader Optimus Prime and his Decepticon rival Megatron will come to the big screen this September in Transformers One, with Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry voicing the friends turned enemies. The first trailer for Transformers One sets the tone for the Cybertron-set adventure, with Prime (then known as Orion Pax) and Megatron being pretty chummy in a buddy comedy kind of way.
But Paramount Pictures has promised that Transformers One will explain how the pair devolve from brothers-in-arms to sworn enemies, so expect plenty of drama in the Industrial Light & Magic-animated feature. But as the first trailer illustrates, expect a fair amount of transforming goofs and slapstick action â a lot of it thanks to Autobot B-127 (aka Badassatron, aka Bumblebee).
Optimus Prime and Megatronâs early years have been explored in animated series and comic books, but Transformers One appears to be an original take on their shared origin story. It also promises to have a Unicron-sized scope, according to longtime Transformers movie series producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura. âYou could not make this movie live-action,â the producer told Polygon last year. âIf we did it in live-action it would cost twice what we normally would spend on a big Transformers movie.â
Joining Hemsworth and Henry in the animated filmâs cast are Scarlett Johansson as Elita, Keegan-Michael Key as Bumblebee, Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime, and Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion. Josh Cooley, the former Pixar artist and screenwriter who directed Toy Story 4, is helming Transformers One. Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari, who co-wrote Ant-Man and the Wasp and Huluâs No Exit, penned the script.
Transformers One will hit movie theaters on Sept. 20.",https://www.polygon.com/24127435/transformers-one-trailer-chris-hemsworth-optimus-prime,2024-04-18 14:15:00
Everything we know about Hades 2,"Supergiant Gamesâ modern classic roguelike, Hades, is getting a sequel. Following a surprise announcement at the 2022 Game Awards, Hades 2âs early access launch is getting close. The game promises to take players beyond the Underworld in the company of a new heroine, MelinoÃ«.
As launch nears, weâre learning more about the game: in particular, a Supergiant livestream previewing the gameâs April 2024 technical test lifted the lid on some new characters and gameplay elements. Other details come courtesy of Supergiantâs announcement and FAQ, as well as the trailer.
Supergiant has confirmed that it will release Hades 2 in an early-access version on PC, as it did for the original Hades, in the the Spring of 2024 (sometime between April and June). Hades 2âs early-access build will be available on both Steam and the Epic Store. Supergiant has promised it will have âat least as much content from day one in Early Access as the original game did back when it launched in Early Access on Steam.â Before the early access release, Supergiant will conduct a technical test for select players in April 2024.
Supergiant has not announced a release date for the final, âv1.0â version of Hades 2 yet. The developer has been working on the game since the start of 2021, but says âWe still have a lot left to build.â The game is expected to be released on PC and consoles, but the specific platforms will be announced closer to its release.
As with the original game, the time between the early access and v1.0 launches will be punctuated with major updates that expand the gameplay, introduce new characters, and move the story forward. The conclusion to the story will arrive in the v1.0 release.
Hades 2 has a new protagonist â MelinoÃ«. In the gameâs lore, she is Hadesâ daughter and the sister of Zagreus, star of the first game. According to Supergiant, sheâs âan immortal witch and sorceress with powerful magical abilities.â
Like Zagreus, MelinoÃ« isnât a pure creation of Supergiantâs, but an existing figure from Greek mythology that the developer has adapted to fit its story. Sheâs a nymph or moon goddess, and a bringer of nightmares, associated with the queen of the underworld, Persephone, as well as with Hecate.
Oh, and this is how to pronounce her name:
Thatâs Hecate! In the FAQ, Supergiant says Hecate will be an important figure in the game. In fact, she is perhaps the chief inspiration for Hades 2 and its theme of witchcraft.
âCentral to this ancient and oft-feared and misunderstood practice is Hecate, the secretive goddess of witchcraft and the crossroads,â Supergiant says. âShe plays a significant role in classical mythology surrounding Hades and the Underworld, and has been an influential and deeply compelling figure in witchcraft, myth, and folklore in a variety of cultures for thousands of yearsâ¦ so much so that we felt we needed a whole new game to try and do her justice.â
In the technical test, it was revealed that Hecate serves as the boss of the first region explored in Hades 2: Erebus, the pathway to the Underworld. She wants to test MelinoÃ«âs mettle in combat before allowing her to travel further. Hecate is also the ruler of the Crossroads, the hub area in the new game.
Hades 2 is a sequel, set after the events of the first game, both in and beyond the Underworld of Greek myth. The villain of the piece is Chronos, the Titan of Time, and Hadesâ father. Chronos has escaped imprisonment in the Underworld to wage war on Olympus; MelinoÃ« will take on his forces, assisted by âthe full might of Olympus.â
Supergiant promises âa bigger, deeper mythic worldâ than the first game, with âa sweeping story that continually unfolds through your every setback and accomplishment.â
Beyond MelinoÃ« and Hecate, new characters confirmed for Hades 2 so far include: Dora, a cute ghost who may or may not be Pandora; Nemesis, a fallen warrior and one of the daughters of Nyx; Arachne, the first spider, who supplies armor; Moros, son of Nyx; and Odysseus himself, who plays the role of tactician and adviser.
New Gods from the Olympian pantheon join the game, too. Apollo, God of Light is here, along with Hestia, Goddess of Flame; Selene, Goddess of the Moon; and Hephaestus, God of the Forge. Naturally, they all bring new sets of themed boons to choose from when you encounter them in the course of a run. For example, Apollo can offer a Daze curse that blinds enemies, and Hestia a Scorch curse that burns enemies over time.
Returning Olympian Gods seen so far include Demeter, Poseidon, Aphrodite, Zeus, and Artemis. Artemisâ appearances are a little different â in some chambers, she will test MelinoÃ«âs strength with waves of foes before granting her boon.
Other returning characters include Hypnos (although he seems to be fast asleep) and training master Schelemeus.
Oh, and the identity of the narrator is revealed (no spoilers), plus everyone is somehow even hotter than they were first time around.
Highlighting the gameâs theme of witchcraft and MelinoÃ«âs magical powers, Hades 2 has a new resource, Magick, appearing above the health bar. Magick is used to unleash powerful, chargeable Omega attacks.
The gameâs primary long-term upgrade system is the Altar of Ashes, found back at the Crossroads. Here you can deposit Ashes and other resources gathered during runs to flip over arcana cards that grant permanent upgrades. Unlocking cards reveals adjacent cards to unlock later. There are nine cards in the technical test version of the game, but more will be added later.
We currently only know about two weapons in the game; the Sister Blades, which draw enemies in for close-range blasting, and the long-range Witchâs Staff.
Thereâs a new crafting system: the Cauldron. Here you can donate items from your inventory to the Three Fates in return for an incantation that can change things about the world, such as adding new weapons or characters.
Casting has also changed, with MelinoÃ« able to place down casting circles to freeze or otherwise affect enemies, adding a powerful crowd control element to her toolkit.",https://www.polygon.com/23501759/hades-2-trailer-release-date-characters-melinoe,2024-04-18 14:10:15
Star Trek: Lower Decksâ creator is turning Segaâs Golden Axe into an animated comedy,"Segaâs arcade hack-and-slash beat-âem-up Golden Axe is being adapted for television. In something of an unexpected twist, that TV series will be an animated comedy. Mike McMahan (Star Trek: Lower Decks, Solar Opposites) and Joe Chandler (American Dad!) will co-write the first episode and executive produce the 10-episode series, Comedy Central announced Wednesday. The announcement came two days after Paramount revealed that season 5 of Lower Decks would be the seriesâ final installment.
Golden Axe heroes Ax Battler, Tyris Flare, and Gilius Thunderhead will face down the evil Death Adder in the animated comedy, and theyâll be joined by an all-new character: inexperienced adventurer Hampton Squib, voiced by Communityâs Danny Pudi. Joining Pudi in the voice cast are Matthew Rhys (The Americans) as lightning-powered dwarf Gilius, Lisa Gilroy (Jury Duty) as fiery swordswoman Tyris, and Liam McIntyre (Spartacus) as the earthshaking Ax â who does not fight with an ax, and is described as âa barbarian warrior with a strict code of honor and sweet golden retriever demeanor.â
Comedy Centralâs Golden Axe will feature another deep-cut character from the franchise: Chronos âEvilâ Lait, voiced by Carl Tart (Star Trek: Lower Decks). Chronos is the black panther/human hybrid warrior from Sega Genesis sequel Golden Axe 3, who was turned into a beastman by that gameâs big bad boss, Damned Hellstrike. This is a game series with really good character names, folks.
Animation studio Titmouse, responsible for series like Big Mouth, Frog and Toad, The Legend of Vox Machina, and much more, is animating the Golden Axe series.
Golden Axe is one of several Sega adaptations in the works. The third Sonic the Hedgehog movie will hit theaters later this year (with Keanu Reeves joining the franchise as Shadow), and a spinoff centered on Knuckles the Echidna drops on Paramount Plus in April. Thereâs also a Streets of Rage movie in the works, with John Wick franchise creator Derek Kolstad at the helm.
Sega has been trying for the better part of a decade to turn its video game properties into film and television projects. The company has previously announced adaptations of games like Shinobi and Rent-A-Hero, without much to show for it. But 2020âs Sonic the Hedgehog movie appears to have accelerated Segaâs plans, with more projects finally coming to fruition.
Golden Axe is also being revived in video game form. At last yearâs The Game Awards, Sega revealed modern iterations of its medieval fantasy beat-âem-up alongside new versions of Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage.

Park Chan-wookâs Oldboy is getting a TV series adaptation,"Lionsgate Television announced on Wednesday that the studio is set to produce an English-language television adaptation of Park-chan Wookâs 2003 thriller Oldboy. The movie, one of the most mesmerizing, memorable dark action movies of the 2000s, started a new wave of Korean action cinema when it was first released. Itâs since spawned endless copycats and homages â particularly its grim, bloody single-take hammer-in-a-hallway fight sequence, which filmmakers still frequently cite as an inspiration for their own battle scenes in constricted spaces. A 4K restoration was released in American theaters in 2023, and came in second at the box office in its first week, beaten only by Barbie. Spike Lee remade the movie as an English-language thriller in 2013, but itâs never been adapted for television before. 
Oldboyâs story follows a drunken Korean salaryman, Dae-su Oh (Choi Min-sik) who wakes up after a bender to find heâs been imprisoned in a run-down room in a dilapidated hotel. His captors donât speak to him â his only interaction with them comes in the form of food trays, and occasional haircuts and other physical maintenance after heâs been drugged. They hold him for 15 years, as his mind disintegrates and he hones his body for war. Then they abruptly release him onto a rooftop, with no explanation. The rest of the film is a combination mystery and revenge thriller, as he tries to find out why this happened to him, and punish his captors.
The film is loosely based on an eight-volume manga series by Garon Tsuchiya and Nobuaki Minegishi. The original Japanese story goes into considerably more depth with the characters, has a more conventional gangster-underground flavor, and takes the plot in a different direction. Lionsgateâs announcement doesnât specify whether the new show will draw on the parts of the manga that Park didnât use, and no showrunner or cast has been announced yet. Park Chan-wook and his producing partner Syd Lim will produce the series. 
Park spent decades in movies, directing films like his signature Vengeance Trilogy (Oldboy, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance), the lush book adaptation The Handmaiden, the dark, funny vampire tragedy Thirst, and 2022âs terrific Decision to Leave. Since 2018, heâs been expanding into television, producing the series version of Snowpiercer and directing and producing two spy thrillers adapting celebrated novels: the 2018 AMC miniseries The Little Drummer Girl, and the new HBO thriller The Sympathizer, starring Robert Downey Jr. 
Lionsgate didnât provide many details about the planned Oldboy TV adaptation â a showrunner and cast have not yet been announced, and the initial press release didnât address possible directions or storylines. A release date has not been set.",https://www.polygon.com/24132968/oldboy-tv-adaptation-park-chan-wook-manga,2024-04-17 17:01:00

Surreal puzzler Lorelei and the Laser Eyes announced for May release,"Sayonara Wild Hearts developer Simogo announced a release date for its next game, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, during Nintendoâs Indie World showcase on Wednesday. Itâs set to hit Nintendo Switch and Windows PC on May 16.
Announced in 2022, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is a much more macabre-looking experience than Sayonara Wild Hearts. Youâll enter a mysterious, black-and-white manor in central Europe, where youâll wander the halls as a woman with laser eyes (presumably Lorelei) to solve puzzles and spot patterns. Simogo and publisher Annapurna Interactive have kept a lot of Lorelei and the Laser Eyes a big mystery â and to best understand it, youâll have to just dive right into playing it. It couldnât look more different than Sayonara Wild Hearts, save for the female protagonist and dreamy, surreal art style, but looks to be no less exciting.
Wednesdayâs trailer gives us a taste of the mystery and intrigue, with all sorts of different puzzles all within its weird world. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is the Swedish studiosâs ninth game, following Sayonara Wild Hearts in 2019.
Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is out May 16 on Nintendo Switch and Windows PC via Steam.",https://www.polygon.com/24132816/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-nintendo-direct-april-2024-release-date,2024-04-17 14:22:14
Did Knuckles have an OK time at the Knuckles premiere?,"Knuckles, Paramount Plusâ episodic spinoff of the Sonic movies, is gliding under the radar. Between Fallout commanding all of the video-games-can-actually-make-for-good-TV discourse and news that Keanu Reeves will voice Shadow in the third Sonic movie due out in December, it would be easy for even the most dedicated Sega buff to forget that an entire six-episode series starring the Master Emerald guardian is dropping next week. 
One person who has not forgotten: Knuckles, who may be feeling the pressure if his vibe on the echidna-red premiere carpet is any indication.  
Knuckles arrived to the Knuckles premiere in London with the glow of a newly minted star. While he was the breakout of 2022âs Sonic the Hedgehog 2, the spinoff puts his name right in the title and solidifies him as a key player of any and all future iterations of the franchise. Everyone wanted a piece of Knuckles at the premiere on Tuesday night.
Despite being an absolute unit, it didnât take long before established stars entered the arena and challenged Knuckles on his home turf. Cast members Idris Elba, Adam Pally, Rory McCann and Kid Cudi all showed up, ready to soak up the spotlight. Themâs the breaks in Hollywood, baby.
The carpet quickly devolved as the Knuckles cast turned into knuckleheads. Their leading man didnât look thrilled.
Knuckles tried to keep his cool throughout the night, but even Elba and Pally could see his frazzled quills. One assumes Knuckles went through substantial media training before stepping out on the carpet for his own show, but it didnât kick in on Tuesday night.
When his fellow actors rushed off to take their seats for the premiere, Paramount wrangled Knuckles for one more photo op â an act of premiere-night redemption. Here he is with footballers CloÃ© Lacasse, Sabrina DâAngelo, Emily Fox and Amanda Ilestedt for some reason. He looks thrilled.
Knuckles shouldnât worry â his TV show, which premieres on April 26, is actually pretty good (more on that later). But his walk on the Knuckles red carpet was fraught. We pray that this is not another case of young talent thrust into the unforgiving glitz and glamour of superstardom, where talent can vanish in an instant. Knuckles, if you are out there: We support you, we believe in you, we hope you have fun.",https://www.polygon.com/24132864/knuckles-cast-idris-elba-premiere,2024-04-17 13:56:16
Watch Nintendoâs new Indie World showcase here,"Nintendo will broadcast a new Indie World presentation on Wednesday, April 17, a showcase that promises âroughly 20 minutes of announcements and updates on indie games headed to Nintendo Switch in 2024,â the company said in an announcement Tuesday. 
The new Indie World showcase will stream live at 10 a.m. EDT/7 a.m. PDT on Nintendoâs YouTube and Twitch channels. You can watch Aprilâs Indie World in the embedded video above.
Indie World showcases typically come with new game announcements, demo releases, and surprise drops. Youâll definitely want to check out the Nintendo Switch eShop later today.
Nintendoâs most recent Indie World showcase aired in November 2023, and featured Switch games Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, Backpack Hero, Blade Chimera, Core Keeper, and others. Nintendo hasnât said which indie games are expected to appear during Wednesdayâs showcase, but expectations that the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong could appear are higher than ever. Team Cherryâs follow-up to Hollow Knight was recently rated by Australiaâs ratings board, typically an indicator that a gameâs release is imminent.
Unlikely to appear during Aprilâs Indie World is the companyâs next console. âSwitch 2â is reportedly coming sometime in early 2025, and we may not hear official details on that next-gen console until summer or fall.

Hades 2 is giving fans their first chance to get their hands on the game,"Super fans of Hades will soon get their first chance to get their hands on an early version of the gameâs sequel soon. According to the recent update from the developer Supergiant Games, the team is âcloseâ to launching Hades 2 in early access, but before it does, the game will have its first âtechnical test.â The team didnât specify how long the technical tests will run, but we know they will âbegin shortly,â via X on Tuesday. 
We're getting close to launching HADES II in Early Access!  A key step prior to that is our Hades II Technical Test, which we plan to begin shortly.If you'd like to be considered for participation, you can sign up right now simply by clicking 'Request Access' on the Hades IIâ¦ pic.twitter.com/BfAqWxjixP
As its name implies, Hades 2 is the sequel to the acclaimed action game, Hades. Just like  the original, Hades 2 will be an action roguelike adventure set in a mythological underworld inspired by Greek mythology. Youâll fight with some cool swishy weapons. Die. Fight some more, maybe in a different place this time. Die again. If youâre lucky, youâll get to flirt with a shockingly hot character. Overall â its approach to story, gameplay, and art direction are looking a whole lot like Hades â which is very much a good thing given how well Hades pulled it all off. 
The biggest changeup will be its protagonist. Instead of playing as Zagreus, Hades 2 will allow players to fight as a mysterious unnamed character known as the Princess of the Underworld. A description of the game touts a âbigger, deeper mythic world,â where the Princess of the Underworld will fight to vanquish the forces of the Titan of Time and will wield the god-like powers of Olympus. We donât have a ton of information on new gameplay like weapons, but trailers and game descriptions so far have said sheâll wield witchcraft and dark sorcery to fight. 
According to previous updates, Supergiant Games plans to release the early access of the game in spring 2024. This technical test will help the team identify and solve issues that it missed up to this point, and help ensure that the early access version of Hades 2 is as polished as possible. Supergiant Games has stressed the importance of user feedback plays in its development process, so if youâd like to be one of the early pioneers of playtesting the next Hades game, well you can sign up for a chance to do it now on Steam.

Overwatch 2âs mythic skin prices revealed to be (unsurprisingly) very expensive,"Overwatch 2 season 10 is now live, with a few important changes to how Blizzard is monetizing the game. Most notably, the hero shooterâs new hero Venture is free for all players, and no longer locked behind the battle pass. Overwatch 2âs battle pass now also pays out multiple kinds of currency, including the premium paid currency known as Overwatch Coins and a new type of currency called Mythic Prisms, which players can spend on mythic-tier skins.
Mythic Prisms are spent in a new section of the Overwatch 2 shop. Players can spend the new currency on this seasonâs new mythic skin â Vengeance Mercy â or mythic skins from previous seasons. Complicating the matter a bit is that the two most recently released mythic skins (for Moira and Orisa) wonât be available in the shop until future seasons.
In addition to offering Mythic Prisms as part of the premium battle pass, Blizzard is also selling that new currency, letting Overwatch 2 players catch up on mythic skins they may have missed from past seasonsâ battle passes. The price of Mythic Prisms may be eye-watering for players who are looking to directly purchase mythic skins, but likely wonât be a surprise for longtime Overwatch fans who have been conditioned to expect to pay $20 or more for a single skin.
Mythic Prisms are now being sold through Overwatch 2âs in-game store in three bundles:
A base-level mythic skin, without additional customization options, costs 50 Mythic Prisms, or $39.99. A fully-upgraded mythic skin costs 80 Mythic Prisms. That makes the total starting cost of a complete Mythic skin around $70, depending on which bundle players purchase.
That sticker shock will likely lead to a lot of grumbling about the cost of mythic skins, since thatâs equivalent to the costs of many AAA console and PC games. But for players who purchase the premium battle pass (which costs $9.99), theyâll get enough Mythic Prisms each season to purchase a fully upgraded mythic skin if they invest the time to complete the pass up to level 78 (out of 80 tiers). Alternatively, players could spend only 50 of their 80 Mythic Prisms earned through the battle pass to unlock the base skin, saving the remainder for other skins or mythic skin upgrades.
Hereâs how Blizzard explains how players earn Mythic Prisms over the course of completing the premium battle pass:
Starting on Tier 8, youâll collect 8 Mythic Prisms every 10 tiers until Tier 78. 
At Tier 48, youâll be able to unlock the base level of Mythic hero skin that you want to collect.
Once you complete Tier 78 of your Premium Battle Pass, youâll earn enough Mythic Prisms to unlock the remaining customization levels for your Mythic hero skin.
Mythic Prisms can only be earned by progressing through the premium battle pass or through directly purchasing Prisms, Blizzard explained in an FAQ about Overwatch 2âs new Mythic shop. Other currencies, such as Overwatch Credits and Coins, canât be used to purchase mythics, just Mythic Prisms.
Blizzard has said that its new approach to unlocking mythic skins is designed to give players more choice. Players who never touch Mercy may not see much value in paying for the battle pass to unlock her mythic skin, and can now spend those newly earnable Mythic Prisms on cosmetics for their favorite characters. But the new Mythic shop will undoubtedly inspire more negativity toward Blizzardâs heavily monetized free-to-play shooter; after all, Blizzard just added a bunch of older skins that a new player could spend upward of $500 on, if they went all in on Mythic Prisms.
That may be the price to pay (or not) for a reversal of one of Blizzardâs most controversial decisions around Overwatch 2: putting heroes behind a paywall. Now that thatâs been undone, it appears that Overwatch whales will be the ones footing the cost.",https://www.polygon.com/24132048/overwatch-2-mythic-skin-store-prices-prisms,2024-04-16 18:00:00
"Echoâs Alaqua Cox is waiting for Marvelâs call, but wants to branch out from villainy","With Marvelâs Daredevil: Born Again wrapping up production, one fuzzy unknown is the future of another character in the street-level sagaâs orbit: Echo. Alaqua Cox tells Polygon she is in the dark, too; unlike some of her peers who got their start on Disney Plus shows, Marvel hasnât mentioned to the 27-year-old actor when or if Maya Lopez will reappear in the MCU.
âI havenât heard anything yet!â Cox said through a sign language interpreter during a recent press day for Echo. âIâm waiting for them to call me. Iâm saying, âCome on. Letâs bring it on!â I hope Iâll be involved in more MCU projects â that would just be amazing.â
Introduced in Hawkeye and given her own eponymous spinoff this January, the introduction of Kingpinâs surrogate daughter was a launchpad for a new face not just in the MCU but in a Hollywood lacking in Indigenous icons. When Cox landed the role of Echo, the actor, who is of the Menominee and Mohican nations, became the first hard-of-hearing and Indigenous screen superhero. 
âThat was my first acting role ever,â Cox said, still in minor disbelief that it all went her way. She had dreamed of acting from a young age, watching the Oscar-nominated (and future Echo co-star) Graham Greene pave the way in Hollywood for Indigenous actors, and in looking back she still isnât sure why she was the one who got the nod from Marvel Studios. Then the company went the extra mile: Since Cox uses a prosthetic in place of her amputated right leg, Maya was written as an amputee, in a break from comics canon. But once she got over her surprise, Cox threw every ounce of herself into the physically demanding stunts.
âThose were my favorite parts of the whole filming experience,â Cox said. âI love doing all the physical activity and work. I grew up playing different kinds of sports. I have an older brother; we used to wrestle all the time, so weâre very close. So yes, the stunts were definitely my favorite and I really like to face those challenges as well.â
Looking back, Mayaâs big fight during a speeding train heist stands out as the pinnacle of her time in the MCU thus far. The sequence required long stretches of overnight shoots, and the demand of the choreography was more about staying centered than surviving combat or stage falls. 
âI was not a big fan of coffee before filming Echo,â she says. âIâm a coffeeholic now.â
Cox would suit back up as Echo if the story demanded it, but she says sheâs also ready for the next role, whatever it may be. 
âI like traveling. I like playing different characters. I donât of course want to take the bad guy character all the time. Iâd like to have other roles, but I want to try something new like a horror or comedy â something other than a bad guy character!â ",https://www.polygon.com/24131270/echo-alaqua-cox-interview-maya-marvel-mcu,2024-04-16 14:00:00
"Keanu ReevesÂ to voice Shadow in Sonic 3 movie, says report","When Sega dubbed 2024 the year of Shadow the Hedgehog, the company really wasnât kidding. Now, itâs looking like beloved actor Keanu Reeves may be the voice of Sonicâs rival in the Sonic 3 movie. The casting was confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday, citing multiple anonymous sources.
Paramount is set to release Sonic 3 on Dec. 20, 2024. Fans always knew that Shadow would make an appearance in the upcoming Sonic 3 film. The post-credits teaser in Sonic 2 showed a brief look at him, but Sega has yet to formally reveal who will play him on screen. 
Word of Reevesâ involvement, if true, comes as a bit of a shock, but he has been maintaining a steady pace of work lately. He continues to star as John Wick in the series of the same name. John Wick: Chapter 4 came out in 2023 and definitely leans into the actorâs knack for action, but Reeves seems down for a good time. He played Johnny Silverhand in CD Projekt Redâs Cyberpunk 2077 and also appeared as himself in the CGI SpongeBob movie. Fans will have to wait to see just how he will approach voicing the broody Sonic character. 
The Sonic live-action casting continues to bring in the best of both the video game and the cinematic world. Hollywood stars like Ben Schwartz and Jim Carrey have brought new life to characters like Sonic and Dr. Robotnik, respectively. However, die-hard fans of the game and animated series get to relish in performances like that of Colleen OâShaughnessey, who played Tails in Sonic 2 and previous Sonic media like the games and animated series.  
The news comes just before the arrival of Knuckles, Paramountâs live-action spinoff starring the iconic echidna. Idris Elba, who plays Knuckles in Sonic 2, will reprise his role in the six-episode series later this month. So if this potential casting has got you excited for more live-action Sonic content, know that Knuckles will stream exclusively on Paramount Plus beginning April 26.
Update: Weâve added release information for the film Sonic 3 to this story.

Dimension 20 opts out of controversial Ticketmaster pricing after ticket costs climb past $2K,"It seems like the perfect concept: Dimension 20âs Unsleeping City, an actual play Dungeons & Dragons campaign about the secret magical underbelly of New York City, played live in front of a paying audience at the Big Appleâs hall of halls, Madison Square Garden, for one epic night of adventure â an event dubbed âGauntlet at the Garden.â 
But maybe itâs just too perfect to exist in a world with Ticketmaster, as many prospective showgoers discovered this week when the conglomerateâs dynamic pricing system kicked in, sending the cost of some single tickets skyrocketing past $2,000. The Dimension 20 crew and parent company Dropout issued a statement on Sunday, writing that they had requested that Ticketmaster cease using dynamic pricing for these tickets, and outlining measures to address fan frustration.
Here is confirmation of exactly what I was afraid of.I entered yesterday 21 in the cue, in the first batch. Every ticket was available to me. Front row on the floor VIP was ~$250. They all disappeared immediately. Those same seats back today at a staggering $2361.20 pic.twitter.com/chykGJZK9m
Ticketmaster, a company whose Wikipedia page has a âCriticism and controversiesâ section with no fewer than 13 subsections at the time of this writing and a âSee alsoâ section that includes the concept of monopoly itself, merged with events promoter Live Nation in 2010. Its dynamic pricing system employs an algorithm to adjust prices on tickets for âOfficial Platinum Seatsâ in real time, as demand rises and falls, without a clear ceiling. This can result in ticket prices multiple times greater than those set by the artist or performer.
In a statement posted Sunday on Dimension 20âs social media accounts, the Dimension 20 cast explained that the dynamic pricing system and platinum tickets âhad not been something explained to us, nor something presented as something we had the ability to opt out of - once we had a better understanding of the situation as a group, we communicated to Live Nation that it was our desire to opt out of all dynamic pricing tickets for this event & for all events going forward.â 
Overall, Dimension 20âs statement noted, of the more than 15,000 âGauntlet at the Gardenâ tickets sold so far, the average cost was $119. âGauntletâ will also be filmed and made available to stream on Dropout.tv at a later date.
Dynamic pricing has drawn the ire of Ticketmasterâs customers since its implementation in 2022, particularly around concert tours for the likes of Bink-182, Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay, Harry Styles, and Taylor Swift â and it has even received pushback from performers themselves, like The Cureâs Robert Smith. Ticketmaster avers that dynamic pricing is a deterrent to the behavior of ticket scalpers: Itâs difficult to buy tickets at face value and resell them at a markup if, when demand is hot, tickets already cost much more than the sticker price. âDynamic pricing is about capturing more value for the artist,â a spokesperson told the New Statesman in 2022. 
But itâs no wonder that many ticket buyers feel that these Platinum Seats are simply incorporating a mercenary practice into a mandatory system. This issue is compounded for customers and artists by how difficult it is to avoid working with Ticketmaster entirely. A 2023 study by the American Economic Liberties Project found that Live Nation âuses its promoter and artist management business lines as bargaining chips to gain exclusive contracts with venues.â Its position in the marketplace is further enhanced by the fact that Ticketmaster/Live Nation handles ticket sales for â78% of the top grossing arenasâ in the U.S., including Madison Square Garden.
In addition to its comments on dynamic pricing, Dimension 20âs statement outlined an upcoming lottery system for fans, dubbed âDimensioneer Tickets,â in which âselected individuals will have the opportunity to buy up to two tickets for $35/each (for seats placed all over the event space, including the best seats in the house).â More information on the lottery will be released âsoon,â according to the statement.
In the meantime, weâll be watching to see exactly what happens in the live D&D scene now that a D&D live show sold more than 15,000 tickets to one of the most storied U.S. arenas in less than a week.

Thelma the Unicorn might be the animated successor to Napoleon Dynamite ,"Netflixâs new animated movie Thelma the Unicorn isnât exactly about a unicorn. Itâs actually about a barn pony masquerading as a unicorn, once she realizes that the pink glittery glitz could be her one chance at superstardom.
The film is based on a picture book by Aaron Blabey (who also wrote and illustrated The Bad Guys), and it comes from an unlikely director duo: Lynn Wang, the showrunner behind Cartoon Networkâs UniKitty!, and Napoleon Dynamite writer-director Jared Hess.
In the 20 years since Napoleon Dynamite came out and became a certified cult classic, Hess has one major takeaway.
âPeople relate to oddballs more than theyâre willing to admit,â Hess told Polygon in an interview ahead of Thelma the Unicornâs release. âDeep down, weâre all nerds. Weâre all insecure. You want to rally behind those people.â
He brought that sentiment to Thelma the Unicorn. Thelma (Brittany Howard) and her pals are a group of lovable misfits who keep getting told they donât have the star potential they need to follow their musical ambitions. But when Thelma gets a chance to hide her true self, she takes it â much to her friendsâ chagrin.
In the trailer, we see Thelma under the tutelage of a slimy-looking manager (voiced by Jemaine Clement), leaving behind her small barnyard roots and her best friends. But lying about her identity will only get her so far â after all, this is a movie about self-acceptance and finding your true self. 
âI was really drawn to the story for Thelmaâs journey,â Wang told Polygon. âI really just related to the journey of self-acceptance and what she was going through. And thatâs why I really wanted to tell that story. Because I wish it was a story that I had when I was younger. Itâs something that I still am trying to figure out now, even as an adult.â

4 key things we learned at CinemaCon about 2024âs biggest movies,,https://www.polygon.com/24128842/new-movies-2024-cinemacon-best-trailers-clips,2024-04-12 22:06:08
Deadpool & Wolverine extended look is a swear-filled explanation of a multiversal mission,"Deadpool is gearing up for his MCU debut, and the latest look at the threequel gave us more of what we really want: Wolverine. Nine minutes of Deadpool & Wolverine was shown during Disneyâs CinemaCon 2024 presentation on Thursday, which also included the first trailer for Marvelâs Captain America: Brave New World (slick, small-ish spy movie) and an update on Thunderbolts*, which now has an asterisk in the title. But on to Deadpool 3. 
The extended first look starts with Wade Wilson selling used cars with is usual vulgarity, all while claiming that heâs officially done with superhero work. But despite his seemingly ordinary life, Wade canât help but feel that someoneâs watching him, which leads directly to to the birthday party that starts the movieâs first trailer. After a few zingers, an awkward romantic reunion, and an extended bit about cocaine, Wade gets abducted by the Time Variance Authority, seemingly kicking off the movieâs main plot. 
To introduce that mission at hand, Matthew Macfadyenâs agent shows up to explain what the TVA does, and that for some reason, Deadpool is very necessary to saving the future (and helping anyone who missed Loki play catch-up). In fact, Macfadyen says, it might be necessary for him to avenge something, at some point. While explaining this, Wade gets a glimpse of possible futures for the sacred timeline, including Thor crying over Wadeâs dead body. After this explanation, Wade takes a second to grab the camera and yell, âSuck it, Fox, Iâm going to Disneyland!â Then he suits up in a new and improved costume. So if there was any question whether Disney would sand the edges off the Merc with the Mouth, fear not, at least in the beginning, this is still the same old Deadpool.
After all that, CinemaCon audiences were shown a scene in which Deadpool and Wolverine are in the car together. Wade makes fun of Loganâs yellow suit and asks if Fox made him wear it, before the whole thing cuts to black.
Introducing the clip on stage during CinemaCon, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige called the movie âfucking awesome,â three times over, which he said heâs allowed to say since the movieâs officially rated R â a first for Disneyâs Marvel movies.
Deadpool & Wolverine is directed by Shawn Levy and co-written by Levy, Ryan Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells. Alongside Hugh Jackman and Reynolds, the new movie will also feature Matthew MacFadyen (Succession) and Emma Corrin (The Crown), as well as plenty of returning faces to the series like Morena Baccarin, Karan Soni, and Leslie Uggams. 
Donât expect the clip to appear online, but good news: CinemaCon broke the first look on Jackman in his costume days prior â courtesy of a soda cup. So who really needs a new trailer?

Avatar: The Last Airbender creatorsâ first movie finds its Aang,"Netflixâs live-action adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender is just a couple of days away, but thereâs more Avatar coming, in case you forgot. The creators of the original series and Legend of Korra, Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino, are hard at work on a new sequel film series following the characters of the original show, along with a few other projects that are still in the works.
Hereâs everything we know about all the Avatar projects that are on the way and what the future of the animated Avatar universe looks like. 
No discussion of the future of Avatar would be totally complete without a discussion of this question. Konietzko and DiMartino are cornerstones of the Avatar creative universe and were originally working with Netflix on the streaming platformâs live-action version of the show, but they split after a couple of years on the project. Unsurprisingly, there arenât many details about why exactly they left the show other than each one citing âcreative differences.â
After their break with the Netflix team, Konietzko and DiMartino went back to Paramount Studios, the parent company of Nickelodeon, to start up Avatar Studios, a team entirely devoted to projects within the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe. Avatar Studios is the studio behind every project on this list, and likely even more projects set in the universe. 
The new Avatar will actually be an animated, theatrically released film series, and will be a direct sequel to Nickelodeonâs Avatar: The Last Airbender. The films will follow Aang, Sokka, Katara, and the rest of Avatar gang as they move through the adult world, filling in the gaps of what happened between The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra. The movie will be directed by Lauren Montgomery, who worked on the original series, as well as Voltron: Legendary Defender.
The first installment is set for release on Oct. 10, 2025. In April 2024, Paramount announced that Kpop star Eric Nam will voice Aang in the upcoming movie, with Dave Bautista (Dune 2) voicing the unknown antagonist. 
A post shared by Avatar: The Last Airbender (@avatarthelastairbender)
This series, first revealed by Avatar News, will follow the Earth Avatar who followed Aang and Korra. According to Avatar News, the series will take place 100 years after Korra in a much more modern version of the world. The series is set to arrive sometime in 2025. Avatar News further reports that an animated movie for this particular Avatar is also in the works, but thereâs no word of when that will happen. 
Prince Zuko is apparently getting his own movie as well. Another report from Avatar News says the Zuko movie is supposedly coming in 2026, though itâs unclear at the moment how this movie connects to the adult Aang movie. It seems likely that it would happen after that movie canonically, given the respective projectsâ release dates.

"After Barbie tackled the patriarchy, Margot Robbieâs Monopoly movie could take a shot at capitalism next","Margot Robbieâs production company LuckyChap, fresh off multiple Academy Award nominations for its blockbuster hit, Barbie, is taking on a new challenge â a film based on the board game Monopoly. The announcement was made Wednesday at CinemaCon. But unlike Barbie, where the climax centered around the toyâs original female creator as embodied by the diminutive Rhea Perlman, the circumstances behind the creation of Monopoly are fraught for an entirely different reason. Will LuckyChap rise to the occasion with another feel-good hit that opens the door to forgotten history, or will it work to further obscure the gameâs origins?
In The Monopolists: Obsession, Fury, and the Scandal Behind the Worldâs Favorite Board Game, author Mary Pilon does an incredible job uncovering the secret history of Monopoly. Her investigation, published in 2015, reaffirms that Lizzie Magie, a staunch leftist in her day, invented and patented the precursor to Monopoly known as The Landlordâs Game in 1903. That board game was not a tale about the joys of capitalism, but its dangers, and while it was influential in progressive circles at the time it never became a commercial success. Only later, in the 1930s, would Magieâs work be used as the foundation for Charles B. Darrowâs Monopoly, the game that would find its way to Parker Brothers and, eventually, the vast catalog of intellectual property now owned by Hasbro. You can read more thanks to an excerpt published at The Guardian nearly a decade ago, but the book itself comes highly recommended.
Given that backstory, it makes sense that Robbieâs company would take a shine to the project. Itâs yet another story of a woman sidelined by the machinations of corporate intrigue. But in the case of the original Barbie, the creator Ruth Handler was also the co-founder of Mattel. She greatly profited from her invention. Magie not so much, and, tragically, her original idea was perverted into the mirror opposite of her intent. Itâs no less a troubling story than the generational traumas of American feminism, but itâs a very different tale that LuckyChap has to tell.
Further complicating the optics here is the fact that mere months ago Hasbro completed a draconian series of layoffs that eliminated just less than one-third of its labor force, a maneuver that was finalized exactly two weeks before Christmas 2023. In a way, those layoffs mirror the story of Monopoly itself, with those who performed the labor of creation becoming disenfranchised from the revenues that would have otherwise rewarded their success.
LuckyChap clearly has its work cut out for it. First it took on the patriarchy. Now it could have capitalism squarely in its sights. Will it flinch? ",https://www.polygon.com/24127426/margot-robbie-monopoly-announcement-hasbro-lizzie-magie-capitalism,2024-04-11 19:03:08
Monarch: Legacy of Monsters gets a season 2 (and a few spinoffs),"Godzillaâs latest return capped an excellent first season for Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. The Apple TV Plus seriesâ season came to an end in January, and it gave us a pretty clear picture for how the show ties into future Godzilla movies. But that doesnât mean there isnât room for another season.
And as of April a second season is officially happening â and more! Apple TV Plus announced it is not only picking up Monarch for season 2, but also announced âmultiple spinoff series based on the franchise.â Hereâs everything we know about Monarch: Legacy of Monstersâ second season.
Yes! Apple TV Plus announced the renewal on April 11, 2024, promising to bring Godzilla back to the small screen â possibly in a couple different ways. In the same announcement, the streamer announced it had struck a multi-series deal with Legendary Entertainment for more series as well. 
âWe couldnât be more excited for viewers to not only have the chance to experience even more thrills in season two, but to embark on epic, new journeys in the franchise, as we expand Legendaryâs Monsterverse,â Morgan Wandell, head of international development for Apple TV Plus, said in a statement.
It might not be any time soon. Since the show hasnât announced production on the new season yet, we probably wonât be getting it until at least the back half of 2025, and maybe even later. 
A great question â in a meta way, heâs probably there to tee up Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which came out a few months after. But in the story, heâs simply another titan thatâs passed through to our world.
Season 1âs finale left everyone in a strange place â literally, in the case of Shaw (Kurt Russell), whoâs trapped in Axis Mundi. Cate (Anna Sawai) and Kentaro (Ren Watabe) meet their grandmother Keiko (Mari Yamamoto), and along with May (Kiersey Clemons) they all manage to escape back into our world, only to find that the situation has drastically changed. 
For starters, Kentaro and his dad are now working with Apex Cybernetics. And they are very interested in evacuating the spot the Axis Mundi survivors just landed in, because Kong is angrily stomping through the trees nearby. 
This may seem shocking, but technically Monarch has been set in the past â nestled in the timeline just after 2014âs Godzilla. By jumping ahead in time, weâre closer in-universe to the events of Godzilla vs. Kong.
Monarch could continue being the ground-level connective tissue between the Monsterverse movies. It could potentially further bridge Godzilla vs. Kong and The New Empire, but it could also be dealing with the fallout of the latter, if the series wants to jump ahead in time. Either way, the actors behind the main trio agree theyâre excited to see their characters take more of an active role in the machinations of Monarch (and now Apex). 
âI like that Cate finds purpose towards the end,â Sawai says of her characterâs ending. âBecause up until then sheâs running away from everything. And sheâs kind of forced into finding answers, and I think there is so much potential in where sheâs going. I hope that if there is [a season 2], that we get to see her take [initiative] and walk with the confidence her grandma has.â 
Clemons hopes a new season lets May âhave to take responsibility for her actionsâ when it happens: âI want to see that put her in a position of choosing if she wants to be a person in power or not, and what she would do if she had a lot of power.â 
Considering how close May and Cate were getting by the end of season 1, season 2 could lean into their relationship â possibly (hopefully?) by making it more overtly romantic. 
âThereâs an attraction. But thatâs not the focus of the story,â Clemons says. âItâs kind of cool, because I feel like they just told us that this is where we kind of maybe want this to go, and I think it just happened organically, you know? We kept that in the back of our mind.
âIf we have a season 2 itâs on,â Clemons laughs.
Your move, Legendary!
While the wait for Monarchâs potential second season could be long, the good news is that thereâs plenty of great Godzilla movies to watch until then. While you could always catch up on the decades of movies Godzilla has starred in since he burst onto the scene in 1954, you could also just stick to more modern fare. Thereâs Shin Godzilla from 2016, as well as 2023âs Godzilla Minus One. Of course, you could also go back through the rest of the Monsterverse to get ready for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which is set to hit theaters on March 29.

Thereâs an official House of the Dragon coloring book coming soon,"Penguin Random House is publishing an official coloring book based on the Max series House of the Dragon. If youâre a fan of the show and want to engage in some meditative coloring ahead of the second season, you can pre-order the $18.99 book from Amazon, Walmart, Target, and Barnes & Noble ahead of its May 7 launch.
The book features over 75 beautifully drawn original illustrations that featuring the houses and avian reptiles from House of the Dragon. According to George R.R. Martin, who recently announced the coloring book on his personal blog, these illustrations are based on âthe most dramatic moments from the show,â and printed on thick paper (his site provides two free images you can print out to color, if you want a sample). While the complex drawings in this book are clearly geared toward adults, none of them are explicit or violent. 

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
House of the Dragon is a prequel series set roughly 170 years before the events of Game of Thrones. It is based on George R.R. Martinâs book Fire & Blood, which follows the dynasty of the Targaryen family at the height of its power. The show introduces a new cast of characters to the Game of Thrones franchise and features all of the political infighting, backstabbing (metaphorical and literal), and gossip youâve come to expect from the series, along with plenty of dragons, of course.

"Overwatch 2 is making good guys bad, bad guys good in a new mirror universe mode","Blizzard is giving the heroes and villains of Overwatch new allegiances in season 10 of Overwatch 2, thanks to a new Mirrorwatch mode coming to the competitive hero shooter. That means heroic versions of baddies like Widowmaker, Doomfist, and Sombra, and villainous versions of good guys Reinhardt, Tracer, and Brigitte.
The inverted good and evil roles arenât just simple skins, however. As shown in a launch trailer for new season 10 hero Venture, Mirrorwatch will also give the former heroes and villains reimagined abilities that match their alignments. The heroic version of Doomfist, for example, appears to have stolen Reinhardtâs big shield so he can protect his teammates, not just himself, from enemy fire. The evil Talon version of Mercy gets a twist too, letting her fire projectiles from her Caduceus Staff â an ability recently teased in Overwatch 2âs April Foolsâ Day event.
Mercy is the recipient of this seasonâs mythic skin, a Talon-inspired style known as Vengeance Mercy. Other skins based on the good-is-evil, evil-is-good twist from Mirrorwatch will be available for characters like Ana, Baptiste, Sojourn, and Symmetra, either in the battle pass or from the in-game shop.
Thursdayâs trailer for season 10 of Overwatch 2 also includes one more tease: Blizzard and Porscheâs collaboration skin for D.Va is coming to the game soon. 
Overwatch 2 season 10, which will add Venture to the playable roster and bring big changes to the battle pass and availability of mythic skins, launches on April 16. The gameâs Mirrorwatch mode will run from April 23 to May 16.
For now, you can check out a sneak peek at season 10âs skins in the gallery below. ",https://www.polygon.com/24127482/overwatch-2-season-10-skins-mirrorwatch-mode,2024-04-11 17:21:50
"Fallout 4 is finally getting a next-gen update, just in time for the TV series","Conveniently timed following the release of the Fallout TV show, Bethesda has announced that its most recent mainline Fallout game, Fallout 4, will be getting a free next-gen update for PS5 and Xbox Series X. 
According to a post on the official Fallout blog on Thursday, console players will finally get a next-gen version of the 2015 game in a native application, which will allow them to play it at up to 60 frames per second when the update goes live on April 25. There will also be quality and performance modes that will allow players to choose between a higher resolution or higher frame rate. If players have the game on older consoles, theyâll still receive an update with stability improvements and other fixes. 
PC players will also get a free update with next-gen features, including ultrawide monitor support. Plus, interested players can now get Fallout 4 on the Epic Games Store. And for those who have always wanted to play it on the go, the game will be Steam Deck verified. 
In addition to next-gen quality of life features, Fallout 4 is also receiving new content, including a quest that features the Enclave, along with Enclave-specific character and weapon skins, that originated in the Creation Club. Thereâs also the new Makeshift Weapon Pack, which allows players to use random objects, like a piggy bank, as weapons, along with Halloween-themed decorations for your Boston-based settlements.
This Fallout 4 update has been a long time coming. Skyrim, originally released in 2011, received its next-gen update on the 10th anniversary of its release, and for a while there was little word on if something similar would be coming to the Fallout series. While Bethesda announced that a next-gen release was in the works in 2022 as part of the seriesâ 25th anniversary, it was later delayed to 2024. 
The Fallout series has been on a lot of peopleâs minds lately thanks to the Fallout TV show, which debuted on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday. While it isnât a direct adaptation of any of the games, it features characters, factions, and worldbuilding that Fallout fans will be familiar with. While the next-gen update wonât be out for two weeks, that gives fans plenty of time to watch the show before hopping back into the game. 
However, if you want to play some Fallout now there are other options. Bethesda previously announced that Fallout 76 is 80% off for the standard edition and 67% off for the deluxe edition, and is temporarily free to play. Xbox players can hop on from April 9-19; PlayStation users can play from April 10-24; Steam players can play for free starting April 11-19. Elements from the TV show have also been added to Fallout Shelter. ",https://www.polygon.com/24127478/fallout-4-next-gen-update-bethesda-tv-show,2024-04-11 17:15:48
One author thinks your D&D party should get out more and socialize... in-character,"You meet in a tavern, the game master says at the beginning of nearly every campaign. Itâs a trope as old as the role-playing genre itself, and for good reason. As owner of Violet Daisy Games, AnnaMaria Phelps, admits, it offers a lot of flexibility. âA tavern [is] a blank canvas,â Phelps said in a recent interview with Polygon. âYou can start with a fight, or you can start with a rousing song. But what if you started because you met at a May Day celebration? Or what if you started because a thief robbed everyone, and youâre all chasing him together through a marketplace?â
Clever meet-cutes can lead to clever storytelling, Phelps said. Thatâs why she created You Donât Meet in a Tavern, a book of prompts currently being funded via Gamefound that is designed to give your party new jumping-off points for your epic TTRPG adventures.
âI think a lot of people have a session zero where they create a backstory,â Phelps said, referencing common comfort and safety practices encouraged by most modern TTRPG publishers when new players gather around the table for the first time. âBut [with the prompts included in You Donât Meet in a Tavern] you can really see people getting into their characters â what the background of those characters are, how theyâre going to be acting throughout the adventure, et cetera, et cetera. So itâs an opportunity for the GM to see the characters, and experience the characters, and kind of breathe them in. Not just as a piece of paper â Hereâs my backstory! â but as genuine people.â
One sample prompt shared to the campaign page, which currently has a little over a week to go, sets the stage on a long-distance voyage where a ship becomes wrecked. Characters whoâve only just met aboard the ship must now take stock of their situation as they gather their belongings along a rocky beach. Another, tamer starter mentioned during our interview takes place at a gnome-led âsculpt-and-sipâ â the fantasy equivalent of a night out with friends at the local wine bar.
In addition to her interest in game development, of course, Phelps said the book project grew out of a her own real-life experiences moving all around the country. Thatâs how she discovered some of her own favorite gaming groups â including one that she could only find through the regional Renaissance fair. Those experiences got her thinking about what other kinds of everyday scenarios could be extrapolated out into fantasy or even science fiction settings. 
âIt started with a couple of prompts for personal use,â Phelps said. âAnd then I was like, Oh, you know, Iâll expand this, Iâll make a little zine or something. And once I got to about 50 prompts, I was like This is probably going to be longer than a zine.â
The crowdfunding campaign for You Donât Meet in a Tavern has a little over a week left to raise a modest $7,700. Funds will go to production but also to paying more than a dozen artists and writers collaborating on the project. Delivery of the digital version is expected by October this year, with a physical version arriving in February 2025.",https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24126673/you-dont-meet-in-a-tavern-ttrpg-book-preview,2024-04-11 13:50:29
Five Nights at Freddy 2 hitting the big screen next year,"Five Nights at Freddyâs, the mostly reviled 2023 horror game adaptation that was also a colossal financial hit, is coming back to movie theaters. Universal Pictures announced a Five Nights at Freddyâs 2 during its CinemaCon 2024 presentation on Wednesday. 
The presentation didnât include any details on which cast members would be back for Five Nights at Freddyâs 2 or Emma Tammi would return to direct. While details on the new Blumhouse movie were thin, Universal did announce that it would be done time for a fall release next year. The sequel announcement shouldnât come as much of a surprise considering the original movie made nearly $300 million dollars at the worldwide box office. 
Universalâs presentation included quite a few other horror announcements for 2025, including Wolfman, directed by The Invisible Manâs Leigh Whannell in January. Perhaps even more importantly, Universal announced that its other horror breakout of 2023, M3GAN, would get a sequel in 2025 as well.

Blizzard announces a remix for one of World of Warcraftâs best expansions,"World of Warcraftâs current expansion, Dragonflight, is winding down. While we know whatâs next â weâll be heading into three expansions that are collectively called the Worldsoul Saga â the team at Blizzard has been having fun with some much more experimental and unique patches. This includes Plunderstorm, a pirate themed battle royale, and now a Remix of the Mists of Pandaria expansion. 
Blizzard has re-released past expansions before; the gameâs first few expansions have all been re-launched on the Classic servers. This Mists of Pandaria remix will be available on the current-day servers, with accelerated leveling. Players will have to make a new character to experience the Remix, but the loot system has been dramatically mixed up, with new and wild effects. Thereâs more loot, available from nearly every activity on Pandaria, and it has powerful effects like the ability to create a storm, transform into a orb of pure lightning, or conjure potent shields.
While players have to make all new characters, theyâll be able to keep all of the transmogrification items that they collect. Transmog allows players to write over their gear to get the visual appearance of past collections, and this form of dolly-dress-up is very popular among fans. While Pandaria progress wonât carry over into The War Within expansions, the cosmetics are a way to fondly remember those achievements. And if players donât want loot, theyâll be able to convert it into Bronze, a new currency for toys, mounts, and cosmetics.
As someone who missed out on the original run of Mists of Pandaria but never found the time to commit to Classic, Iâm very excited to take another spin through the beautiful lands of Pandaria and collect some fun toys along the way. Thereâs no launch date for the Remix yet, but we can expect it to arrive before the next expansion The War Within.",https://www.polygon.com/24126587/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria-remix-announcement,2024-04-10 21:57:51
9 of the biggest announcements from the first Triple-i Initiative showcase,"Amidst the glut of video game showcases from large publishers and Summer Game Fest, the Triple-i Initiative is trying something a bit different. This collective of top indie developers includes Evil Empire (Dead Cells DLC), Thunder Lotus Games (Spiritfarer), Mega Crit (Slay the Spire), and many more, who all gathered together to show off what theyâre calling âiii gamesâ â or âblockbuster indie titles.â
âSince using letters seems to be the trend in the industry, we figured that adding a couple of iâs to indie was a fair way to describe this new format. Also, triple-i just sounds cool,â said Evil Empire marketing director BÃ©renger DuprÃ©.
The very first Triple-i digital showcase debuted Wednesday and ran for around 45 minutes with over 30 announcements, including content updates, release dates, and, of course, game reveals. Watch the full stream for the entire lineup â but in the meantime, here are nine big announcements and reveals from the showcase.
A sequel to the acclaimed deckbuilding roguelike Slay the Spire has been revealed. The teaser didnât show us much when it kicked off the Triple-i showcase, but from screenshots sent to the press, we know there will be a new class â called the Necrobinder â joining the Ironclad and the Silent. The game will be hitting early access in 2025. 
Dead Cells has been a running theme across the Triple-i showcase, and this Risk of Rain 2 announcement was no different. Gearbox Publishing announced that the game will be teaming up with Motion Twin for a Dead Cells crossover, which will include a Prisoner skin. The free Devotion update will also include a new map and more.
Dinolords seems like a traditional medieval city builder and tower defense RTS at first, except for one twist: the enemies ride around on dinosaurs. Feels like thatâs all you need to know. Itâs coming to Steam Early Access first, although no date was revealed. Still, you can wishlist now. 
Vampire Survivors is teaming up with Konami for the Operation Guns DLC, joining the forces of the undead and the Contra series for a release on May 9. The trailer is expectedly full of the frenetic action the game is known for, but now you can fight with retro assault weapons and as a werewolf with a gun. Ahead of the DLC announcement, it was also revealed that the game would be coming to PlayStation 4 and 5 in summer 2024.
Never Alone, from 2014, was a puzzle platformer centered around a traditional IÃ±upiat story, which separated it quite a bit from other games at the time. Never Alone 2 was announced back in 2022, but the Triple-i showcase revealed the first trailer. The game will feature an original story by an IÃ±upiat writer and will follow a new story with Nuna and her arctic fox companion from the first game. 
Darkest Dungeon 2 is getting a huge update later this year â  with a whole new standalone campaign called Kingdoms, which features new monster factions and more. 
Fans of the survival crafting hit Palworld have something to look forward to. An arena mode is coming to the game sometime this year. The teaser shown off during the showcase is... extremely short, but you can watch it if you want to know every scant detail.
Cataclismo is a real-time strategy and tower defense game from Digital Sun, the developers of Moonlighter. The game takes place in the city of Hogar, which has to defend itself against horrible creatures coming from the mist. There will be magic, ancient civilizations, and âLegoâ-style building, according to the developers. Itâs set to launch on PC July 16.
This isnât the Sands of Time remake â but Evil Empire, the development team behind post-launch Dead Cells content, is releasing an indie Prince of Persia game that will hit Steam Early Access on May 14. This roguelike action-platformer takes a lot of inspiration from both Prince of Persia and Dead Cells, and it comes with an excellent cinematic trailer. ",https://www.polygon.com/24126337/top-announcements-triple-i-initiative-showcase-2024,2024-04-10 18:09:15
"Dead Cells teamâs new roguelike is... Prince of Persia, actually","We thought we were done with the Prince of Persia franchise in 2024, but we were wrong. Evil Empire, one of the studios behind indie hit Dead Cells, is launching The Rogue Prince of Persia next month in Steam Early Access. 
Evil Empire was created as a way to continue development on Dead Cells while Motion Twin, the original development team, moved on to other projects. The studio worked on that game for around five years and released two DLC packs â Return to Castlevania and The Queen and the Sea â before it was announced there would be no more updates to the game. 
The Rogue Prince of Persia is Evil Empireâs first official game, but it takes a lot of inspiration from Dead Cells. That means youâre getting Metroidvania-inspired action-platforming gameplay with roguelike elements. The trailer that was released on Wednesday starts off with a dynamic cinematic showing the Prince running from enemies and getting fatally shot with arrows. Then it transitions into showcasing the gameâs 2D platforming.
The Rogue Prince of Persia will be launching in Steam Early Access on May 14, so youâll only have to wait around a month to see what itâs all about. There isnât an expected final release window just yet. ",https://www.polygon.com/24126419/rogue-prince-of-persia-dead-cells-evil-empire-reveal,2024-04-10 17:57:34
Palworld developer teases the gameâs upcoming PvP mode,"Itâs time to call your Pals from out of the mines and into the battlefield. Palworld developer Pocketpair teased the gameâs upcoming PvP mode on Wednesday. As previously announced, the new mode is called Palworld: Arena and it will allow players to assemble teams of Pals to fight other players. 
Pocketpair showed the new look as part of the Triple-i Initiative showcase dedicated to highlighting the work of indie developers. The brief cinematic trailer showed two teams of Pals ready to fight in a coliseum setting. According to a tweet from the gameâs official X account, the new PvP mode will hit âlater this year.â
The scrappy indie studio Pocketpair released the early access version of Palworld in January 2024 and the game became an overnight sensation. The game skyrocketed to the top of the Steam charts, became the most-played third party game on Xbox Game Pass, and sold over 8 million copies in under a week. 
The new PvP mode follows the development plan the creators outlined back in January. At the time, the team said it had plans to add new features to the game like raids and PvP. In March, Pocketpair announced the addition of the gameâs first raid and now it appears players will get the PvP content this year as well.

The Joker 2 trailer introduces Lady Gagaâs Harley Quinn to the hallucinatory stage,"Nearly five years after the release of Joker, the Oscar-winning DC comics-inspired drama starring Joaquin Phoenix, its sequel is finally ready for a spotlight. The first trailer for Joker 2 debuted on Tuesday at CinemaCon, the trade show for all things theatrical release, and shows off Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, and some of the new music that has been rumored for the film.
Joker 2, officially called Joker: Folie Ã  Deux, will have a few returning faces like Phoenix as the Joker, formerly known as Arthur Fleck, as well as Todd Phillips, who once again directs from his own script. Along with Lady Gaga, the movie also adds the likes of Catherine Keener (Get Out), Ken Leung (Old), and Brendan Gleeson (Banshees of Inisherin) to its cast. 
On the CinemaCon stage, Phillips said the intention was to make Joker a one-off, but that by the end of production on the first film, he was talking to Phoenix about doing a follow-up âbecause it was so fun and we liked the character of Arthur and Joker so much.â In the throes of the pandemic, the two resuscitated the idea âand now weâre here.â
Rumors dating back to Gagaâs casting have suggested Joker: Folie Ã  Deux was a full-blown musical, but like trailers for recent films like Wonka and Mean Girls, the dance-filled trailer goes hard on eerie whimsy without any trace of actual song-and-dance performance. Phillips may be holding back some cards, as is marketing tradition for modern movie musicals, but at CinemaCon addressed the rumors of how musical-y things would get. 
âWeâve never really talked about the movie like that [as a musical],â he said. âI like to say itâs a movie where music is an essential element. Which to me doesnât differ that far from the first film. When I first described Arthur I explained him as a weird lonely guy but he has music in him.â
Joker: Folie Ã  Deux is set for release in theaters on Oct. 4. ",https://www.polygon.com/24124435/joker-2-trailer-lady-gaga,2024-04-10 01:07:22
EA enlists Dead Space remake team to work on next Battlefield game,"Electronic Arts is adding Motive Studio, the team behind Star Wars: Squadrons and the 2023 remake of Dead Space, to the roster of developers working on the next Battlefield game. Byron Beede, general manager for the Battlefield franchise, and Patrick Klaus, general manager of Motive, announced the formation of a Battlefield-focused team at Motive on Tuesday â an announcement that also signaled the end of seasonal content for Battlefield 2042.
Motive will be one of four studios working on the Battlefield franchise alongside DICE, Criterion, and Ripple Effect. EA recently announced the closure of Ridgeline Games, a studio established in 2021 to work on narrative-focused Battlefield content. Some workers at Ridgeline were moved to Ripple Effect. 
âWe have an ambitious vision to embrace and unlock the vast potential of the seriesâ class-based squadplay and immersive, intense battles,â Beede said, noting that multiple EA-owned studios are developing âconnected multiplayer experiences and single-playerâ content set in the Battlefield franchise.
Battlefield 2042âs current and seventh season, Turning Point, will be its last, Beede confirmed. âAfter Season 7 concludes, we will continue to support the game with new in-game challenges, events, modes, and of course, ongoing maintenance, but we are moving away from delivering official seasons,â he said. âWe know this news may be disappointing. However, as we looked at what the future of the series required, it became clear it was time for us to shift our resources and focus to be fully dedicated to what comes next.â
The Motive team working on Battlefield will be led by Philippe Ducharme and Roman Campos-Oriola, directors of the Dead Space remake, Klaus said. 
Klaus noted Motiveâs previously announced Iron Man project will continue, led by Olivier Proulx and Ian Frazier. âIron Man is an important priority for Motive, and Iâm very proud of the work weâve accomplished so far,â Klaus said. The untitled Iron Man game was revealed in 2022 as âan all-new single-player, third-person, action-adventure.â EA is also working with Marvel on a Black Panther game.
The formation of a Battlefield-focused team within Motive brings the future of the recently revived Dead Space franchise into question. Polygon reached out to EA for clarification on what Tuesdayâs announcement means for Dead Space, but a spokesperson referred us back to Beede and Klausâ statements. EA has not announced any additional titles in development at Motive, including a potential remake of Dead Space 2.
Electronic Arts said in 2021, shortly after the launch of Battlefield 2042, that it was handing the reins of the Battlefield franchise to Vince Zampella, co-founder of Apex Legends and Titanfall developer Respawn Entertainment. A few months later, EA CEO Andrew Wilson described the change as part of ârethinking the [Battlefield] development process from the ground upâ and a plan to build a âconnected Battlefield universe.â",https://www.polygon.com/24125300/ea-battlefield-motive-studios-dead-space-remake-iron-man,2024-04-09 20:50:00
Helldivers 2 fans are shaken by the sudden return of Automatons,"Helldivers 2 is a funny game, with great physical comedy that naturally occurs from its robust friendly fire mechanics. Itâs also a challenging game that pits extremely squishy Helldivers with limited resources against endless waves of enormous bugs. But few people talk about how itâs sometimes a terrifying game thanks to the Automatons.
However, on Monday, Helldivers rejoiced over a decisive and collective victory over the Automatons and their claimed territory. These Terminator-style robots are clearly designed to be malevolent. They patrol around, buzzing in binary code, surveying the lands with glowing red eyes. If thatâs not enough to convey âbadâ in visual language, Arrowhead Game Studios has thoughtfully added skulls impaled on spikes attached to their exo-skeletons. The first reaction my primal brain has upon seeing an Automaton is âNOPE.â
I didnât think much further into it because my friends and I were too busy following Major Orders from Super Earth Command on the galactic map. We failed to liberate Tibit, fought for Malevelon Creek, and faced down gunships on multiple planets. I used to think the robots were much rougher than bugs, but I learned new strategies, and it was deeply satisfying to drive the Automatons off the galactic map for good. We all knew that they would return since thatâs how Arrowhead runs the game. We just thought it would take longer than two days.
Somehow, the Automatons returned.As suspected all along, the previous Bot force was merely a vanguard. A massive fleet has now begun an assault of Cyberstan and the surrounding planets. Helldivers, hold back this unprovoked invasion. The fight continues! pic.twitter.com/2DzEued7mm
Players just got back in the groove of fighting bugs again when the Automatons suddenly emerged with a new fleet, forcing us to defend two new sectors. They are making a huge push towards Cyberstan, and the Helldivers are the only thing in their way. And the more time I fight these guys, the more I realize that theyâre actually deeply, existentially scary.
If the player pays attention to dissident propaganda and reads between the lines of Major Orders, theyâll learn that the Automatons were created by the Cyborgs, an enemy faction from the first game who are enslaved in the mines of the former Cyborg capital, Cyberstan.  The Automatons are just trying to reclaim the city.. 
This moral complexity isnât particularly surprising on a meta level; Helldivers 2 is not subtle about Super Earth secretly being the baddies. But it definitely shifted my perspectiveâ¦ until I ran into all the corpse desecration. 
The Automatons are not just doing the necessary amount of murder; theyâre going above and beyond. Their camps are littered with dismembered Helldivers and SEAF troops displayed as trophies. Theyâve also built brain harvesting shrines â perhaps to fuel their endless assembly line of murder? Suddenly, the Super Earth propaganda that theyâre stealing children feels much more plausible. 
Even if the worst case situation is true, and the Automatons are truly harnessing human brains and nervous systems to create endless soldiers for their war, arenât they at least a little bit justified? In some ways, as a player, I empathize with the Automatons, but I canât muster that same sympathy when Iâm in the thick of a battle with them, facing down tanks, rocket devastators, and gunships. 
The Automatons are back, and Iâm going to fight them (because I want my Major Order medals, thank you very much). But I donât feel very good about it. In fact, deep in my bones, Iâm terrified.

Former Destiny leads have a new studio and a new game ,"A team led by the former creative director on Destiny announced Tuesday that theyâre working on a new game under parent company ProbablyMonsters, the studio founded by former Bungie president and CEO Harold Ryan. That new development team is named Hidden Grove, and is working on an original âmultiplayer competitive adventure gameâ built on Unreal Engine 5.
Former Bungie creative director Chris Opdahl is serving as general manager of Hidden Grove. Opdahl is joined by design directors Raylene Deck and Grant Mackay, who worked on Destiny as senior design leads. Hidden Grove also includes talent that has worked on Halo, Destiny, Mass Effect, Dungeons & Dragons, and other AAA gaming properties.
Developers on the Hidden Grove team didnât add much detail about what their unannounced game will be, but Opdahl hinted in an interview with Polygon that it will have battle royale elements. The teamâs project has been fully incubated, developers said, and will go into a closed alpha sometime this summer.
Hidden Grove joins another internal team at ProbablyMonsters known as Battle Barge, which is developing a ânext-gen co-op RPG game.â ProbablyMonsters was founded in 2016, after Ryan left Bungie. 
To learn more about Hidden Groveâs new game and ProbablyMonstersâ mission âto change the way games are made,â Polygon chatted with Opdahl via email. You can find our conversation below. 
Polygon: What do you think makes Hidden Grove unique or different from teams youâve worked with in the past?
Chris Opdahl: The Hidden Grove team shares a lot of DNA with the other teams I have worked with in the past; exceptionally talented people working together to make something that players care about and want to dive into. And we do that by finding a way to work together, resolve conflict, and push each other while also celebrating our successes, all to make an awesome game and hitting our dates. I think the biggest difference is that I have made many mistakes in my career over the years. Iâm hopeful I have made enough mistakes leading teams so that I have learned to get the mistakes out of my system, and this team can benefit from that key learning. 
As far as uniqueness goes, the unique part of this team is both the amazing members and how ProbablyMonsters operates. You rarely work on something new that has all the benefits of real funding and a strong central team to help guide you. We get a lot of that here at ProbablyMonsters and it is a key part of our success.
Can you describe what a âmultiplayer competitive adventure gameâ is? How does that compare to your work on Halo and Destiny?
One of our beliefs is that part of the battle royaleâs genre is that they are more adventurous than previous game modes. They shifted away from the more sport aspects of arena and tactical shooters and into something more free form, something more adventurous. We think there is an opportunity for something new and different than a battle royale by pushing even further into adventurous territory, which has opened up additional options for new types of teamwork and competition.
What was the projectâs incubation period like? How did you know youâd found the game you wanted to make?
When I first started, I had a couple months before the first three members of the team started. I was nervous about getting too far ahead of what we should make before that core team started. I wrote up 12 different game seeds, and shortly after starting, Raylene and Grant, our two design directors, looked through those seeds. They said they were excited about part of one game and part of the other, so we made a new seed that was a combination of both. We then wrote up a user story (a text description) of what we thought the game would play like when we were done. The current game is surprisingly consistent with the core experiences of what we were going for to start.
The longer answer is that one of the biggest mistakes I made in my career was when I started on a new project while the rest of the team was finishing up the previous one and was coming in hot. It took longer for people to join than initially planned and I ended up working on the creative and plans for the next version. When the previous version started to wrap, and a bunch of people joined the project, there were a lot of people frustrated that I had already solved too much of the game without them. My takeaway from that is to do the work as needed to understand, but you donât need to show all of that to people when they start. Instead, turn that work into higher level ideas and talk about these ideas and not the execution. Those higher-level ideas were the game seeds that we ended up discussing and merging. 
We knew we were onto something when the game we made matched up with the initial plans and had the team cheering and excited during playtests. The next big step is to put it in front of players and see how they respond.
How far into development are you? What can you tell us about the game at this stage?
Our production timeline is going well so far, and we are planning an external user research study with our Friends and Family Alpha coming later this summer. We are excited to start putting the game out in front of people who donât work on it directly so we can see how they respond.
ProbablyMonsters describes itself by saying it âaims to change the way games are madeâ â what does this mean to you? What are the practical implications?
When I started, I asked Harold [Ryan] âwhat does success look like to you during development?â I have tons of friends who find it difficult to move their project through the process of getting buy-in from all the decision makers at whatever company they are working at or with. Harold said there are three ways he evaluates if a project is going well. One â are the leadership and development teams excited about what they are making, and do they believe in it? Making games is hard and that team is going to need to make a lot of hard calls during development and being excited about what they are making is the only way to effectively work through those challenges. Two â Is there a believable business case for the game? Part of making the game is also talking about who you think is going to play the game and if there are enough of them to justify the cost of the game. Three â Do external play testers give the game a high ârecommend to a friend score?â Recommending a game to a friend, especially a team-based game like what we are making, is one of the strongest indicators of a playerâs interest in a game. Having a high enough score here is important. And while he never said it specifically, I also know that there is a fourth one as well which is, can your team consistently hit their milestone dates and make progress towards shipping?
That is different than what I have seen at other companies where the usual way to move forward is to convince a large group of decision makers to justify the game you are working on. 
Games are becoming increasingly expensive to make. How are you managing costs and keeping budgets in check?
Set believable milestone dates and then scope the content and effort put into each aspect of the game to hit them. Solve the key innovations in your game early when the team is at its smallest. In my opinion, hitting your dates is one of the more important aspects of effective development, and doing the work early to hit them is vital. You wonât hit every aspect of the game for every deliverable, but you donât want to miss so much that you are carrying heavy risk into the next phase. This team has really impressed me with how much they have over delivered for all our key milestone gates. 
Given that youâve worked on your share of live-service multiplayer games, how do you see that space evolving?
One of the most challenging things in games is making new genres. You tend to see them start initially via mods or from very small teams. In my experience, players tend to attach strongly to new genres that let them experience something new and stick around with those games for a long time. After that genre is proven, publishers try to find new space inside those genres to attach to that market, using higher budgets and production values as the key drivers. That is getting expensive. A company that can fund reasonable budgets to define and ship new genres for players is likely to create real long-term excitement with players. I am curious who ends up being able to do that.

Destiny 2âs Into the Light update adds 12 all-timer weapons back to the game,"Destiny 2âs new Into the Light update brings a load of new features to the game ahead of the upcoming Final Shape expansion. Here are the big things you need to know about Destiny 2âs latest patch and all the free new goodies Bungie has packed into this update.
For a complete list of patch notes for Destiny 2: Into the Light, continue scrolling past our summary.
Onslaught is the horde-like mode Destiny fans have been begging for for years. The new activity will send Guardians into the last city to set up turrets, trip wires, and other defenses to help defend their home from The Witnessâ minions.
The game mode goes up to 50 rounds, and has multiple difficulty modes to really test Guardians.
As rewards for the Onslaught mode, Bungie has reprised 12 of the most famous and beloved weapons from Destiny and Destiny 2. These guns â called âThe Brave Arsenalâ â all have incredible perk combinations and promise to be very potent once The Final Shape rolls around.
Even better, Guardians can collect Limited Editions of these weapons between April 9 and June 3, the day before The Final Shape.
Anyone who started Destiny 2 after Beyond Light in 2020 missed out on the seriesâ two best missions: The Whisper and Zero Hour. Back in the day, these secret missions were the original sources for Whisper of the Worm and Zero Hour, two fantastic Destiny 1 Exotics brought into the modern era. 
With Into the Light, Bungie has reprised both missions and made their Exotic rewards craftable. The Whisper hits Destiny 2 alongside Into the Light on Tuesday, whereas Outbreak fans will need to wait until May 14 for Zero Hour.
Into the Light sees the first major map pack for Destiny 2. This pack includes three new Crucible maps, each of which are supposed to be smaller and more intimate than some of the giant maps Bungie has added in recent years. The maps take place on Europa, Neomuna, and the light-ravaged pyramid.
Destiny 2: Into the Light is all about Bungie bringing players back to Destiny 2 ahead of The Final Shape. And what better way to bring players back than with a shower of high-level loot?
As part of Into the Light, Bungie is bringing back its Gift of the Thunder Gods pack, which is a free chest of loot that contains 1800 (near max) level armor and weapons to instantly bring lapsed and new players back into the fold. 
Pantheon is an endgame PvE activity that challenges players to kill raid bosses in a gauntlet. Guardians will be able to group up and take on some of the gameâs hardest challenges all in a row â and earn some cool, exclusive rewards while doing so. 
Bungie devs promised to reveal more about this activity ahead of its April 30 release date.

The Roundup: Punishment trailer delivers the Ma Dong-seok punches youâre aching for,"Ma Dong-seok (also known as Don Lee) is one of the most exciting action stars in the world, bringing life even to the most charmless of projects. Since 2017, he has anchored The Roundup action franchise, delivering consistent bangers that have lit up the Korean box office and the hearts of action fans around the world. And now, we have a trailer for the fourth installment â The Roundup: Punishment.
This time, Maâs lightly veiled self-insert character Detective Ma Seok-do is taking on a cybercrime ring leading a gambling operation. The movies thrive on Ma Dong-seokâs singular combination of laid-back charm paired with his absolutely massive frame, as he lays down thudding blows (with terrific sound design) on anyone who comes in his way. (A lifelong boxer, Ma punch supercuts have been made in dedication to his prowess in this field). His strengths are on full display in the trailer, with about a dozen of the movieâs many, many hard blows, including an absolutely thunderous punch seven seconds in that sure seems like it would kill a man.
The third entry The Roundup: No Way Out released in limited U.S. theaters in June 2023, but only recently became available to watch on VOD. Itâs the best in the franchise yet (although I have not seen Punishment), and was one of my favorite movies of the year (and had one of my favorite action sequences). 

    Related
  
Punishment sees a change in the directorâs chair, as former stunt choreographer Heo Myeong-haeng takes the reins of the franchise. Heo recently made his directorial debut with the fun sci-fi B movie Badland Hunters (now on Netflix), which starred Ma, and has been a long-time collaborator of the action starâs, including working with him on Train to Busan and The Good the Bad the Weird. Ahead of the release of No Way Out, Ma praised Heoâs work while talking to Polygon.
âAs it is challenging, the coordination and synergy with the stunt team are crucial,â Ma wrote in an e-mail. âHeo Myeong-haeng, the martial-arts director, and the stunt teams in this film have been working with me for 20 years, and they understand my intentions very well. That enables us to create more realistic action scenes.â
Each of the last two movies have been huge successes at the Korean box office. 2022âs The Roundup was the highest-grossing movie in the country that year, and No Way Out was #2 in 2023. The Roundup: Punishment opens in Korean theaters April 24 before coming to North American theaters May 3, via Capelight Pictures and Blue Fox Entertainment. While youâre waiting, all three previous movies are available to stream: The Outlaws on Tubi, The Roundup on Peacock and Tubi, and The Roundup: No Way Out on Hoopa. All three can also be rented or purchased digitally, and theyâre all a fun time, with each installment better than the previous.

Destiny 2 is getting a surprise new subclass in The Final Shape,"Destiny 2: The Final Shape just got a massive update to its back-of-box features list: a new âsubclass,â a new kind of Exotic, and a new enemy faction. Bungie revealed the additions in a livestream on Tuesday, which acted as a reintroduction to the upcoming expansion after it was delayed from February to June earlier this year.
The star of the trailer is the new Prismatic subclass, which allows players to combine all of the other gameâs subclasses into one. Bungie calls this an âadvancedâ subclass, and it looks like itâll offer an entirely new way to play. Prismatic Guardians even gain the ability to use a super-powered grenade that combines darkness and light together. Other subclasses will be getting grenades as well that combine elements: stasis and void for Warlocks; strand and arc for Titans; and solar and statis for Hunters.
Additionally, Bungie announced a new Exotic class item type, which is capable of combining multiple Exotic perks together. Even better, Guardians can get Exotic bonuses from other classes with these items, allowing for some truly wild combos â  although the perks will be random. 
The developers also finally announced a new enemy race, called the Dread â the first since the Scorn were introduced back in 2018, with the Forsaken expansion. These enemies resemble Tormentors, but come in all shapes and sizes. There are mid-level and flying enemies, called the Grim and the Husk, respectively, along with lieutenant enemies, Attendant and Weaver, that use Stasis and Strand.
This is the first time players have gotten a good look at The Final Shape since Bungie revealed the expansion last year. Back then, Bungie told players all theyâd be getting was new abilities for their existing subclasses â like the massive Void ax for Titans. Those are still coming, but the ability to combine them with other subclass grenades and melees makes them far more exciting.
This gameplay showcase comes after three weeks of livestreams from Bungie, all of which were dedicated to the Into the Light free content update that also hit the game on Tuesday. This update is meant to keep players busy and engaged for the next eight weeks, and includes a new mode, the return of 12 beloved weapons, a map pack for PvP, and some of the best Exotic missions in the franchise coming back from the grave. 
Bungie will surely reveal more information around Prism and other prominent features for The Final Shape before the expansionâs June 4 release date.",https://www.polygon.com/24124362/destiny-2-final-shape-subclass-reveal-prismatic,2024-04-09 18:30:02

Pandasaurusâ well-regarded card game narrowly took the award from runners up Dorfromantik: The Board Game and Next Station: Tokyo.
The Strategy Game category, in addition to recognizing Restoration Gamesâ action-focused title Thunder Road: Vendetta as the yearâs best, also made a recommendation of two other titles. Daybreak, a game about climate change by Matt Leacock (Pandemic) and Matteo Menapace, received praise from the judges. Elizabeth Hargrave (Wingspan) and Jeff Fraser  were also recognized for their work on The Fox Experiment.
Finally, in the Complex Games category, The White Castle took home the top prize. Devir Gamesâ latest is a Eurogame with lots of desirable systems, including both worker and dice placement. Also recommended in the category are Nucleum from Board & Dice and Inside Upâs Earth.

"Star Wars Outlaws gets new story trailer, release date from Ubisoft","The next big Star Wars game fulfills a specific fantasy from a galaxy far, far away. As scrappy scoundrel Kay Vess, players will take part in âone of the greatest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen,â according to the narrative setup for Star Wars Outlaws. A new trailer released Tuesday for Massive Entertainment and Ubisoftâs upcoming open-world Star Wars game dives deeper into the story of Outlaws, a single-player adventure set during the franchiseâs original trilogy.
Ubisoft also narrowed down Star War Outlawsâ broad but undefined 2024 release date: The game will arrive on Aug. 30 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.
The latest look at Star Wars Outlaws teases a âgolden age for the underworldâ of the Star Wars universe, with criminal organizations like the Zerek Besh, Pikes, Crimson Dawn, and the Hutts reaping the rewards of a galaxy at war. It also promises a few familiar characters, including a run in with Jabba the Hutt himself, plus heroes and villains new to the franchise.
Star Wars Outlaws is set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, when the Empire was at nearly full strength but âdistracted by a Rebellion that wonât quit.â As Kay, players will navigate through the various factions of the Star Wars universe, including the criminal underworld and the hierarchy of the Empire. On their adventure, theyâll be joined by their furry little alien friend Nix, a Merqaal, and the BX droid ND-5. Kay and friends will visit a variety of planets on their galactic journey, including Canto Bight, Kijimi, Tatooine, Akiva, and a windy locale named Toshara thatâs new to the Star Wars universe.
Star Wars Outlaws is just one of a handful of new Star Wars projects in development under Lucasfilm Games. Developer Respawn Entertainment is working on a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and an untitled Star Wars strategy game. Skydance New Media has an untitled Star Wars game in the works, which is being helmed by former Uncharted creative director Amy Hennig. Quantic Dream has Star Wars: Eclipse, which it describes as âan intricately branching action-adventure gameâ set during Star Warsâ High Republic era. Thereâs also Star Wars Hunters, a long-overdue combat arena game in development for Android, iOS, and Nintendo Switch.

Fortnite is bringing back its Coachella collab with a new twist,"You can pretty much do anything in Fortnite these days. You can hunt down Greek gods, watch the solar eclipse virtually, or unleash a Waterbending fury as a character from Avatar: The Last Airbender.

The Fortnite and Coachella collab will allow players visit a new island location, purchase Coachella-themed cosmetic items, and play tracks from from the Coachella lineup on the Fortnite Festival stage.

Players will be able to explore Sahara Island â a virtual locale inspired by the real-life venue at Coachella â which a release described as âa new music and minigame experienceâ that utilizes music and visuals from Coachella 2024 artists, including Grimes and DJ Snake. 
Fortnite has changed a lot since since the gameâs previous Coachella event last spring. Now, Fortnite works more like a platform where users can log on and play a wide variety of games, in addition to the popular battle royale shooter that comprises its foundation. This growing list of games includes includes Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game where players can form bands and play popular songs from artists like The Weeknd or Lady Gaga. Now Coachella will have a mini-Fortnite Festival takeover where players will be able to perform Jam Tracks from artists performing at Coachella 2024, like Doja Cat and Lil Uzi Vert. 
The event will also introduce new cosmetic items and brings back a few old outfits in Fortniteâs item shop as well.

Horror fishing game Dredge being adapted for live-action movie,"Dredge, the indie adventure game released in 2023 that paired Lovecraftian horror with video gamingâs ultimate activity, fishing, is being developed as a live-action movie, producers of the adaptation announced Tuesday. Working with Dredge developer Black Salt Games to make the film a reality is production company Story Kitchen, which was co-founded by Sonic the Hedgehog movie producer and dj2 Entertainment founder Dmitri M. Johnson.
Johnson is behind a growing number of video game adaptations, including the upcoming Netflix animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft and in-development projects based on Segaâs Streets of Rage, ToeJam & Earl, and Hazelight Studiosâ It Takes Two.
Working alongside Johnson to bring Dredge to live action are Story Kitchen executives Mike Goldberg, Timothy I. Stevenson, and Dan Jevons. âDredge is a captivatingly eerie and profoundly rich story that had us completely hooked from the very beginning,â Story Kitchenâs Johnson, Goldberg, Jevons, and Stevenson said in a shared statement.
âWe are excited to partner with such an experienced studio team to bring the world we created to live action and ignite the imagination of audiences across the globe,â added Black Salt Gamesâ Nadia Thorne, Joel Mason, Alex Ritchie, and Michael Bastiaens.
Dredge casts players as a fisherman exploring a remote archipelago for a variety of fish and hidden treasures. Players encounter quest-giving island residents and learn about their past as they upgrade their vessel, learn new skills, and encounter increasingly unusual sea life.
In our review of Dredge, Polygonâs Nicole Carpenter said the game âmasterfully balances two distinct tones,â pairing dark horror elements with cozy gameplay.

League of Legends is getting a Vampire Survivors-style mode this summer,"A new Dev Update video from Riot Games shares some of the upcoming content for League of Legends. A team of developers shared an update on the gameâs Arena mode, Lee Sinâs upcoming Art and Sustainably visual update, and a new âbullet heaven survivor PvE game mode for League of Legends during this yearâs summer event.â 
Vampire Survivors was such a huge hit that its inspired a whole host of spin-off titles from other franchises, like the recent Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor. The genre, sometimes called an autoshooter, has a character moving around the map and dealing with endless swarms of oncoming enemies while periodically collecting upgrades and stat boosts.
The summer event has been a typical time for Riot to try out some new game modes of features, including the visual novel starring familiar League of Legends champions as Star Guardian magical girls, or the Ruination lore event in Runeterraâs main canon.
Riot will release more information on the changes to the Arena game mode in a dev blog next week, but weâll have to wait a little longer to learn more about the new PvE game mode. Riot has dabbled with PvE game modes before, including ones linked to the Star Guardian and Odyssey alternate universes. It remains to be seen whether this game event will cover any of the existing lore in the League of Legends lore, but it seems weâre not tired of the Vampire Survivors formula quite yet.",https://www.polygon.com/24124492/league-of-legends-survivor-spin-off-summer-event,2024-04-08 19:54:59
Avatar: The Last Airbender is heading to Fortnite tomorrow,"Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation came to Fortnite. Yup, thatâs right: Avatar: The Last Airbender is coming to Fortnite as part of the ongoing Chapter 5 Season 2 content. Three members of the seriesâ main gang â Katara, Toph, and Zuko â will be available for purchase as Outfits in the Fortnite item shop starting Tuesday. 
Epic Games official announced the skins via X. The short teaser video showed Katara approaching Aang frozen in the iceberg, and then showed footage of Zuko firebending and Toph earthbending. The tweet didnât mention an Aang skin would be coming to the shop, but leakers have speculated his skin will come as part of an Event Pass. Each outfit will cost 2,000 V-bucks each, a leaker said. 
Yip yip! Get ready, Avatar: The Last Airbender is coming to Fortnite.Katara, Zuko, and Toph land in the Shop tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/PlP1PWs7Bl
The announcement confirms leaks that circulated around late February. Prior to the formal announcement, developers teased the collaboration by adding a spot in the game where players could go and see Aang frozen in the iceberg. Epic Games also released Korra, from The Legend of Korra, as part of the mid-season Battle Pass release. 
As always, the arrival feels a bit silly. While the animated version of Avatar: The Last Airbender contains its fair share of implied violence, it didnât show darker moments as explicitly. One of Aangâs main struggles comes into play when he needs to find a way to resolve the war with the Fire Nation peacefully, but now his friends will be taking up arms in a shooting game. Sure, Fortnite is far from violent, but I do giggle at the thought of getting a headshot off a snipe while playing as Katara. 
For now, fans will have to wait and see what other changes will come to game. As for me personally, Iâm still hoping Sokkaâs trusty boomerang will make some kind of appearance.

"Jonathan Majorsâ domestic violence trial ends with guilty verdict, no jail time","Actor Jonathan Majors, known for his roles in Creed III, Lovecraft Country, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, was arrested in 2023 on charges of domestic violence and found guilty in December on charges of assault and harassment. In April 2024, Majors was sentenced in criminal court in Manhattan to a 52-week domestic violence program, The New York Times reported, avoiding jail time.
Shortly after the verdict was announced in December, Marvel Studios dropped Majors from subsequent projects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A source close to the studio confirmed to Polygon that there are no plans to work with the actor in the future. 
Majors was arrested on charges of strangulation, assault, and harassment in March 2023. Shortly after Majorsâ arrest, his lawyer released a statement saying that the actor was innocent and that Majors was actually the âvictim of an altercation with a woman he knows.â Majorsâ publicist (who is also the husband of his attorney) released text messages from the alleged victim in hopes that they would clear up Majorsâ involvement. That defense seemed to backfire; the texts, some said, read like they were written by a victim of abuse.
After these details came to light, several productions and agencies reportedly dropped Majors, including his publicists, multiple advertising campaigns, and upcoming movie projects The Man in My Basement and an untitled Otis Redding biopic. Magazine Dreams, a completed bodybuilding drama starring Majors, was removed from the release schedule of film distributor Searchlight Pictures, which is owned by Disney. Majors also stepped down from the boards of the Gotham Film and Media Institute and the Sidney Poitier Initiative.
Since his arrest, Majors has faced further accusations, most notably in a Rolling Stone story that alleged âextreme abuseâ based on dozens of interviews with sources who wished to remain anonymous. Some of these allegations stretched back to Majorsâ time as a student at Yale.
While Marvel remained in business with Majors through the autumn release of Loki season 2 and his trial late in the year, the studio severed ties with him only hours after the verdict was issued in mid-December. The actor was deeply connected to the Marvel Cinematic Universeâs current slate of films. He appeared in the first season of Loki as an adversary named He Who Remains, then played Kang the Conqueror, an alternate-universe version of the same character, in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. That movieâs post-credits scenes set up Kang as a Thanos-sized threat, revealing thousands of time-traveling Kangs and Kang variants.
Kang is an villain integral to the MCUâs current story arc, which was designed to culminate with 2026âs Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and 2027âs Avengers: Secret Wars, in which the character would likely help reset the MCU for a brighter future. Marvel has reportedly considered pivoting away from Kang as the MCUâs primary threat for a more popular villain, Doctor Doom.
Update (Dec. 18, 4 p.m.): This story has been updated to reflect Majorsâ guilty verdict and pending sentence.
Update (Dec. 18, 5 p.m.): This story has been updated with the news that Marvel has cut ties with Majors after the verdict.

Hereâs the official slate of upcoming Star Wars movies and TV,"Star Wars is in an interesting place. Multiple movies have been delayed or canceled after the mixed response to Rise of Skywalker in 2019 and Solo: A Star Wars Story the year before. Since then, most new Star Wars projects have been of TV shows on Disney Plus, ranging from the high highs of Andor to the low lows of The Book of Boba Fett, with plenty of Mandalorian, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and others in between.
At 2023âs Star Wars Celebration, Lucasfilm and Disney outlined their plans for the future of the Star Wars universe, including updating fans on upcoming projects and confirming a few release dates. And as of January 2024, there was another significant update with the announcement of a Mandalorian-led movie. 
Below, you can find the full calendar of upcoming Star Wars releases â what they are, where youâll be able to watch them, and when they come out. And while youâre in the mood for more Star Wars, you might be tempted to catch up on the whole universe. Hereâs the best order to watch it all in.
Set in the later days of the High Republic, this show from Russian Doll creator Leslye Headland will be a Star Wars mystery, focusing on a former Padawan who teams up with her Jedi Master. The cast includes Squid Gameâs Lee Jung-Jae, Dafne Keen (Logan, His Dark Materials), Manny Jacinto (Nine Perfect Strangers), Dean-Charles Chapman (Game of Thrones), Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix), and Chewbacca actor Joonas Suotamo as  a Wookiee Jedi.
Coming to Disney Plus in 2024
Jon Watts, the director of the latest Spider-Man trilogy, helms this show starring Jude Law and a group of kids set around the same time as The Mandalorian. Not much is known about it yet, but Watts has described it as a throwback to â80s Amblin movies like The Goonies, and Everything Everywhere All at Once directors Daniel Kwan and Scheinert directed an episode.
Coming to Disney Plus in 2025
The best Star Wars property of all time? I think so, and Iâm not alone. Andor was a game-changer for Star Wars, and while details are light on the timing and scope of the second season, we know it will be 12 episodes and the end of the showâs run. Season 2 of Andor is slated to arrive in summer 2024, Lucasfilm said at Star Wars Celebration 2023.
Coming to movie theaters on May 22, 2026
The Mandalorian and his furry green friend are headed to the big screen, in a movie directed by Jon Favreau and produced by Favreau, Kathleen Kennedy, and Dave Filoni. No word on what this means for the future of the show, which does not technically have a season 4 announcement, but production on the film, titled The Mandalorian & Grogu, is slated to start in 2024.
Lucasfilm and Dave Filoni are also currently developing a second season of Ahsoka, which may lead up to the events of the Mando and Grogu movie. Hereâs everything we know about season 2 of Ahsoka so far.
This was previously âDamon Lindelofâs Star Wars movieâ, but news broke in March 2023 that he was replaced by screenwriter Steven Knight (Peaky Blinders, Locke, Serenity). Obaid-Chinoy (Ms. Marvel) is directing. The new Star Wars movie will be set in a new era called the New Jedi Order and will be set more than a decade after the events of Episode IX, The Rise of Skywalker.
Actor Daisy Ridley will reprise her role as Rey (uh, Rey Skywalker) in the movie as she tries to rebuild the Jedi order.
The force behind much of Star Warsâ televised content, Dave Filoni, will direct a new movie that plans to focus on the New Republic, the government body that comes into power in the wake of the Empireâs implosion. Lucasfilm says Filoniâs movie will âclose out the interconnected stories told in The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and other Disney Plus series.â Given how much the third season of The Mandalorian has focused on cloning technology and post-Imperial power struggles, Filoni may be looking to fill in lore gaps about the return of Emperor Palpatine and the rise of Snoke in the Star Wars sequel trilogy era.
Director James Mangold (Logan, Ford v Ferrari, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) will helm a Star Wars movie set in the distant past â some 25,000 years before the original trilogy Star Wars era â that goes back to the dawn of the Jedi (literally). Mangoldâs take on the earliest stages of Star Wars will be âa Biblical epic, like [The] Ten Commandments, about the dawning of the Force,â the director said at Star Wars Celebration 2023.
Mangold will explore questions like âWhere did the Force come from, when did we discover it, [and] when did we learn how to use it?â he said.
Not much is known about this project besides Waititiâs involvement (and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns). It was not included in the January 2024 announcement of Disneyâs upcoming Star Wars slate.
Disney first announced this spinoff show about Lando Calrissian in December 2020, and hasnât said a word about it since. On the one hand, that means itâs not officially canceled â Disneyâs been pretty open about cancelling Star Wars projects recently. On the other hand, thereâs been no official confirmation that the show is still happening, or that Donald Glover will return to reprise his role from Solo â but at least we know heâs interested in it.
Frequent Ryan Reynolds collaborator Shawn Levy (Free Guy, Deadpool 3) is making a Star Wars movie. Not much is known about it, other than he hopes it will have a âbig heart.â But there are questions of whether itâll happen; Levy was not included in the January 2024 announcement of Disneyâs upcoming Star Wars slate.",https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23672528/star-wars-movies-tv-schedule-calendar-upcoming,2024-04-05 19:24:29
"Who is subjecting us to these things, and why do they hate popcorn?","Remember at the end of Star Wars: Episode II â Attack of the Clones, when the clone army is headed off to battle and Yoda gravely intones, âThe shroud of the Dark Side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War hasâ? That was the first thing that went through my head when I saw Regal Cinemasâ official post on X (nÃ©e Twitter) revealing the official popcorn bucket for The Garfield Movie.
Weâve entered the era of the ridiculous promotional popcorn bucket, the escalation zone where each major new movie is going to need a more elaborate, more unlikely, more impractical popcorn container than the last. These arenât meant to meet the publicâs slavering demand for popcorn â just for collectible novelty. Itâs only going to get sillier from here.
OK, wait, thatâs an exaggeration. The first thing that went through my head wasnât the Yoda quote. It was the same question raised by most of these collectible popcorn buckets: âBut where does the popcorn go?â
Come for the collectible. Stay for the snacks.'The Garfield Movie' collectible popcorn bucket is coming soon to Regal! pic.twitter.com/jN7SajdXbb
Look, we all know that nobody designing current movie-theater collectible merch is actually concerned with popcorn positioning. These putative snack dispensers are all various degrees of dysfunctional for their stated purpose, whether thatâs because theyâre covered with spiky teeth in the general operational area or because theyâre mimicking existing objects that were not designed primarily as popcorn holders. It really says something that of the recent wave of promo popcorn buckets, the closest any of them has come to functionality was the one that involves eating popcorn directly out of Miles Moralesâ skull.
We also know that the reflexive bafflement here is a feature, not a bug. The Garfield Movie popcorn bucketâs seeming unsuitability for popcorn serving got Polygon staffers talking as we tried to figure out where the popcorn is even supposed to go. Letâs assume the reclining chair is just for presentation, and the actual bowl is just the round Garfield piece. (Which seems likely, except that the scale of the chair seems way off, unless the bucket itself is a foot and a half across.) Is the whole thing hollow? Is the hole in the back of Garfieldâs head, or, um, coming up from underneath him? Do you flip it over to use it, or sit him in your lap and eat out of the back of his head? Do his eyes pop out to reveal a hole that individual pieces of popcorn can be dispensed through? Is the gag here that obviously Garfield, a character known for voracious food-bogarting, has already eaten all your popcorn? 
So yes, we know that weâre falling into Regalâs trap. Weâre helping perpetuate the hype cycle, the no-such-thing-as-bad-publicity cycle, even by raising this question and putting this thing in front of your eyeholes. Weâre sending the clones off to war. The shroud of the Dark Side truly has fallen.
But seriously. Why present something as a popcorn bucket, without any clear idea of where the popcorn would go? And how much more absurd is the next promotional popcorn bucket going to get in order to keep the trend rolling?

Helldivers 2âs new Warbond dramatically increases the chance to blow yourself up,"Some of Helldivers 2âs best moments come through player failure, like when you accidentally shoot your teammate, get killed by a low-level Terminid grunt, or blow yourself up. The ragdoll physics make these mistakes all the more hilarious. And we expect these moments to increase thanks to a new Premium Warbond (the gameâs version of the battle pass), which will be hitting on April 11.
According to the PlayStation Blog, the Warbond, called âDemocratic Detonation,â features a bunch of new weapons to unlock with medals, including a new assault rifle. However, you might notice a theme: most of these new weapons make things explode. For example, thereâs the new CB-9 Exploding Crossbow primary weapon that does exactly what it says on the tin. Thereâs also the new G-123 Thermite Grenade and the GP-31 Grenade Pistol, which are also pretty self-explanatory. 
There is a lot of utility to these weapons â if you use them correctly. You have to throw grenades into bug holes to close them, for example, and the Grenade Pistol, which does, indeed, fire a grenade, can be a great sidearm to have during those missions. Imagine filling your grenade slots with incendiary or smoke grenades instead of having to rely on explosive options when you can just have a handy pistol instead. Meanwhile, the Thermite Grenade can stick to surfaces, which can be useful if you want a bit more flexibility in where you can throw grenades.
Also in the Warbond is a potentially super-helpful utility booster that can call down the extraction shuttle early at the beacon at the end of missions. The Warbond also features standard items weâve come to expect in these packs, including new armor and capes.   
However, as weâve come to know, many arsenal additions in Helldivers 2 have a catch, and thatâll certainly be the case here. You can already see a few downsides in the blog, like how you have to reload the Grenade Pistol in between each shot, or how âgravity must be accounted for when aimingâ the crossbow â whatever that is referring to. And, as we already mentioned, itâs super easy to blow yourself up with your own grenades. However, one of the new armor sets, the CE-07 Demolition Specialist, might help with that since it can âwithstand rapid changes in pressure, heat, and personal velocity.â
This is the second Warbond the developers at Arrowhead Game Studios have added since launch, the first being the Cutting Edge Warbond.
Hereâs the full list of additions coming in the Democratic Detonation Warbond:

The Dreamcastâs most obscure revival breaks free from VR jail,"Last yearâs revival of Segaâs late-Dreamcast-era obscurity Cosmic Smash is coming to a much wider audience in 2024. C-Smash VRS, based on the Sega game that combined Rez aesthetics with racquetball and vintage arcade game Breakout, has been exclusive to Sonyâs PlayStation VR2 headset for the past year, but it will get a version playable on PlayStation 5 without that headset sometime this summer.
Developer Wolf & Wood and publisher RapidEyeMovers call the update to C-Smash VRS the New Dimension version. It will add a third-person gameplay option to the existing first-person perspective of the game, meaning it will soon play like classic Cosmic Smash. This summerâs New Dimension update will also bring âinnovative as-of-yet-unannounced featuresâ to C-Smash VRS.
For VR enthusiasts without a PlayStation 5, C-Smash VRS is also now available on Meta Quest (2, 3, and Pro) and Pico 4.
The addition of a traditional 2D screen option for C-Smash VRS is a surprising, if welcome, update. Itâs also an inversion of how VR support typically works, in which games like Capcomâs Resident Evil 4 remake and Crystal Dynamicsâ Rise of the Tomb Raider were the recipients of post-launch VR modes. 
C-Smashâs incoming update could be seen as another indicator of the health of PSVR2 in the marketplace. Last month, Bloomberg reported that Sony was pausing production of PSVR2 hardware, citing slowing sales and surplus inventory. In February, Sonyâs in-house VR development teams were hit hard with layoffs; the PlayStation maker shuttered London Studios, the team behind PlayStation VR games Blood & Truth and PlayStation VR Worlds, which had since moved on to a non-VR PS5 game; and laid off developers at Firesprite, the studio behind Horizon: Call of the Mountain.

"Star Wars: Unlimitedâs sophomore set delivers with Mando, Dr. Aphra, and Cad Bane","Star Wars: Unlimited, the latest big-budget trading card game to go up against Magic: The Gathering and Disney Lorcana, has had an extremely successful launch. As critics opine on its excellent gameplay, product remains in short supply at retail. But the design team at Fantasy Flight Games isnât letting off of the sublight driveâs accelerator any time soon. Case in point is a series of livestreams that detail its sophomore set, called Shadows of the Galaxy. The first, which aired Wednesday, unloaded a starcruiserâs worth of information on new characters, hints at mechanics, and more.
Senior game designer Tyler Parrott set the tone early on, noting that the set will focus not on a specific point in time from the history of the Star Wars universe, but on a specific kind of character.
âThis is not a set for eras,â Parrott said. âThis is a set for all of the things that exist outside the law in all of the eras of Star Wars.â That message was delivered in front of a poster displaying art for fan favorites Cad Bane and the good Dr. Chelli Lona Aphra herself.
âThere is a prominent Mandalorian theme in the setâ as well, Parrott continued, which aligns with the larger themes of the set as whole since the last surviving Mandalorians found themselves isolated after the fall of their home planet, Mandlore.
Other characters shown off during the stream include Enfys-Nest, Moff Gideon, and even the two-bit thief Bala Tik and the Guavian Death Gang. 
âThis is not the beginning of the preview seasonâ noted host Xander Tabler. Instead, fans should expect a slow roll of additional information over the coming months. Star Wars: Unlimited - Shadows of the Galaxy is expected at retail in July.

Marvel celebrates the number 4 with Fantastic Four movie hints and free comics,"Today is April 4, written out in both Europe and the Americas as 4-4-2024. Marvel Studios has a very vested interest in the number 4, since the mega-studioâs biggest and most interesting project on the docket right now is next summerâs Fantastic Four. This is a perfect recipe for a Fake Holiday: 4-4 Day, when the Marvel Studios account tweets out some (very neat) looking art and a link for âcelebration.â And while its too early for said festivities to include any footage, that doesnât mean there arenât plenty of teases here.
 #TheFantasticFour Celebrate 4-4 Day at: https://t.co/0L6vmfvKPN pic.twitter.com/byRvjcbsNf
First, thereâs that art, which is very much in line with the teaser art that announced the Fantastic Four cast. Two things of note here: 
Then thereâs that link, which leads to a cute 404 page with HERBIE the robot suggesting you look around for a not-very-hard-to-find QR code. 
That code leads to a page from the Future Foundation, which includes a small bundle of free comics: Fantastic Four #1, #48-50, and Fantastic Four: Life Story #1. These are, respectively, the groupâs â60s origin story and the revered Galactus trilogy by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, and then a modern reinterpretation of those stories by Mark Russell and Sean Izaakse. This, taken in conjunction with the period setting and Julia Garnerâs recently-announced casting as a version of the Silver Surfer named Shalla-Bal, strongly suggests that Fantastic Four will attempt to be a definitive take on the Galactus epic, where a world-eating alien arrives on Earth and Marvelâs First Family is the only thing standing in his way. 
This was previously done poorly in 2007âs Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, with Matrix star Laurence Fishburne voicing the Surfer and the towering Galactus portrayed as a... CG cloud? It was very disappointing.  
Regardless, this is the most fun Marvel has made its movie marketing in some time, a nice, stylish low-key rollout, with a hint of the personality thatâs been missing from the studio output for a while. Is it a prelude to a bigger tease or announcement, perhaps during next weekâs CinemaCon in Las Vegas? Or will we have to wait until another 4-themed holiday? Maybe during the PGA championship in May? Because âforeâ sounds like â4?â Iâm sorry. ",https://www.polygon.com/24121000/marvel-fantastic-four-movie-hints-free-comics,2024-04-04 15:42:23
Japanese police arrest suspect making âconstant threatsâ toward Nintendo,"Police in Japan arrested on April 3 a 27-year old man suspected of threatening Nintendo staff, events, and spectators. Due to these threats, Nintendo announced in December it was canceling several events, like Nintendo Live and the Splatoon Koshien 2023 finals, and postponing others. Japanese newspaper the Kyoto Shimbun first reported the arrest. According to the report, the man admitted to the threats.
Nintendo of America confirmed the arrest in a statement to Polygon, where a representative also said the Japanese headquarters âwas receiving constant threats targeting its employees, and most recently, received threats targeting the spectators and staff of the Splatoon Koshien 2023 Grand Final.â
Hereâs the full statement:
Nintendoâs Japanese headquarters was receiving constant threats targeting its employees, and most recently, received threats targeting the spectators and staff of the Splatoon Koshien 2023 Grand Final. Given the threats, Nintendo postponed and cancelled the series of events, and has been in contact with the police ever since. Nintendo is extremely thankful for the investigation and effort made by the police on arresting the suspect. Nintendoâs Japanese headquarters will continue to cooperate fully with the policeâs investigation.
Nintendo Live, the event that was canceled in December, is a big, multi-day celebration of everything Nintendo. It was set to be held at the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition center in January. The Splatoon grand finals were slated for December at the Tokyo Ota Ward General Gymnasium.
News of Nintendoâs event cancelation came during the trial for the devastating 2019 Kyoto Animation arson attack that killed 36 people and injured many others. The attack was one of the deadliest in recent Japanese history. The suspect plead guilty and was sentenced to death in January. In the aftermath of the attack, Japanese police have treated threats with âheightened seriousness,â according to Japan Today. Police have also arrested several people whoâve made threats against both Sega and Square Enix.",https://www.polygon.com/24120900/nintendo-live-japan-threats-suspect-arrested,2024-04-04 14:40:00
Fallout 76 will be free when the Fallout TV show debuts through Amazon Prime,"Amazon Prime subscribers will be swimming in Fallout-related content in April. Bethesda Softworksâ Fallout 76 will be available for free as part of that subscription on the same day that the new live-action Fallout TV series debuts. Starting April 11, Prime subscribers will be able to download Fallout 76 on Xbox consoles and Windows PC as part of Prime Gaming.
Fallout 76 joins two others currently available through Prime Gaming: Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel are both available on PC as part of the subscription.
First released in 2018, Fallout 76 is an open-world multiplayer role-playing game set 25 years after the Great War that led to a nuclear apocalypse that irradiated much of America. Players take on the role of a Vault Dweller as they explore post-apocalyptic Appalachia and fight for survival. Fallout 76 currently goes for $39.99, and is separately available on PC and Xbox through Microsoftâs Game Pass subscription.
The latest expansion for Fallout 76, set in Atlantic City, was released in March.
Amazonâs upcoming Fallout TV series will tell its own story, one set more than 200 years after the bombs dropped. It will feature many of the same sights, rivalries, and the cheeky sense of humor of the Fallout games, but is wholly original and set in a mostly unexplored time period in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles.
The rest of April 2024âs Prime Gaming lineup consists of Chivalry 2, Faraway 2: Jungle Escape, Black Desert, Drawn: Trail of Shadows, Faraway 3: Arctic Escape, Demonâs Tilt, Rose Riddle: The Fairy Tale Detective Collectorâs Edition, Dexter Stardust: Adventures in Outer Space, Living Legends: Fallen Sky, Vlad Circus: Descend Into Madness, and Tiny Robots Recharged.",https://www.polygon.com/24120930/fallout-76-free-download-xbox-pc-prime-gaming-april-2024,2024-04-04 14:15:00
A new Matrix movie is coming from the director of Cabin in the Woods,"Itâs time to re-enter the Matrix, only this time with a new director. The Matrix is coming back for a fifth entry, directed and written by Drew Goddard, Warner Bros. announced on Wednesday. 
Goddard has previously directed Cabin in the Woods and Bad Times at the El Royale. He has even more experience as a writer, with credits like Cloverfield, The Martian, and Netflixâs Daredevil. 
In a statement about the movieâs announcement, Warner Bros. president of production Jesse Ehrman said, âDrew came to Warner Bros. with a new idea that we all believe would be an incredible way to continue the Matrix world, by both honoring what Lana and Lilly began over 25 years ago and offering a unique perspective based on his own love of the series and characters. The entire team at Warner Bros. Discovery is thrilled for Drew to be making this new âMatrixâ film, adding his vision to the cinematic canon the Wachowskisâ spent a quarter of a century building here at the studio.â
While this will be the first Matrix movie without a Wachowski at the helm, they wonât be completely uninvolved. Lana Wachowski, who directed The Matrix Resurrections in 2021, will be back as an executive producer on Matrix 5. Lilly Wachowski, who was not involved in the making of the most recent Matrix movie, similarly does not have a role in the upcoming film. 
Thereâs no release date for Goddardâs Matrix movie yet. ",https://www.polygon.com/24120136/matrix-5-sequel-drew-goddard-lana-wachowski,2024-04-03 17:27:20
You can finally play the real Suika Game on iOS,"Goodbye, App Store Suika Game clones. The real thing has finally arrived on iOS for players outside of Japan. Suika Game, the watermelon puzzle game that went viral on Nintendo Switch last year, is available to download for $2.99 on Appleâs App Store, making it playable on iPhone and iPad. The title for the official version is âSuika Game-Aladdin Xâ and it comes from XGIMI Limited.
Suika Game was quietly released on the App Store for players outside of Japan last month; the game was released on iOS for Japanese players in December. I only realized it was out on iOS because Iâm still way too into the game, and periodically check the App Store. Now that itâs out on iOS, the easy-to-play, hard-to-master game will surely find its way into new hands. Currently, itâs rated the second most popular casual game on the App Store â with very little marketing.
Suika Game is a puzzle game where you drop fruits into a box. When fruits of the same type touch, they merge together into a new, bigger fruit. Cherries combine to form strawberries, strawberries into grapes, grapes into oranges, oranges into persimmons, persimmons into apples, and so on, up until the watermelon. Theoretically, you can continue on forever, because two watermelons touching erases them entirely. Of course, itâs not quite so simple: Suika Gameâs physics make the fruit bounce all over the place, making it hard to organize your stash.
The iOS version of the game has the same premise, but a box thatâs shaped slightly differently to fit into the iPhone screen. You use the touchscreen to move the fruit, which drops when you release your finger. Plus, youâre able to play either vertically or horizontally. Itâs exactly what I expected! An Android version is expected out next month.
If mobile isnât your thing, Suika Game is still playable on Nintendo Switch. This year, developer Aladdin X released multiplayer DLC that lets you play local co-op. Online multiplayer is expected to be added in the future. The game and its DLC is available for $5.24. Alone, Suika Game costs $2.99 on both iOS and Nintendo Switch.

Crunchyroll is finally getting profiles so your family can stop messing up your One Piece rewatch,"Crunchyroll has long been a messy streaming service to share. Since there was no way to make multiple profiles, having multiple users on the same account meant constant shuffling of the Now Watching tab and resetting of the episode order, and it just generally confused the others who also use the account. But all of that should be changing when the platform adds viewing profiles later this month.
The anime streaming service announced the new update to its platform on Wednesday, confirming that Crunchyroll Premium subscribers will now be able to create multiple profiles. The feature will allow users to make up to five profiles to share with members of their household, as well as grant certain accounts parental controls. This also opens up more personalized recommendations for each user, since accounts wonât be such a jumble of shows anymore. 
âFinally. We have been listening to viewer requests and our team has been hard at work to roll out the functionality for multiple profiles on Crunchyroll,â said Crunchyrollâs chief product officer, Kaliel Roberts, in a press release. âOnce multiple profiles are live later this month, fans can truly curate a Crunchyroll experience that feels specific to their tastes.â
Users can choose profile pictures from more than 30 different anime series, with more being added by Crunchyroll as new shows come out. Multiple profiles from a single account can also stream at the same time. 
Along with this new streaming feature, Crunchyroll also revealed a few new additions to its catalog on Wednesday: ",https://www.polygon.com/24120007/crunchyroll-profiles-streaming-anime,2024-04-03 16:00:00

Netflix is definitely bringing The Witcher back for season 4, and while we have a few ideas about whatâs to come, including the seriesâ already infamous recasting, there are still quite a few questions left, including when it might come out. 
Yes, there will be. Netflixâs most official statement on this has been casting Liam Hemsworth as Geralt next season, but that is enough to say for sure that a fourth season is being planned. This isnât too much of a surprise, since The Witcher remains one of Netflixâs most popular series, though the two most recent seasons never reached the viewership heights of the first one.
The Witcher season 4 hasnât even started filming yet, as far as we know, so itâs likely to be a pretty long wait between seasons â and as with every series or movie right now, the ongoing writers and actors strikes in Hollywood is likely to push any release date back even further. The Witcher also frequently goes quite a while between seasons. Season 1 was released in 2019, while season 2 didnât come out until 2021, and season 3 just arrived this year. With all that in mind, itâs likely that we wonât see the showâs fourth season until sometime around 2025 at the earliest. 
Liam Hemsworth will take over the role of Geralt from Henry Cavill in season 4. Weâre still not sure how this swap will happen in the show, or how big Hemsworth-Geraltâs role will be in season 4, but we do know Cavill wonât be in the show next season.
The Witcher season 3 doesnât leave a whole lot of hints about whatâs to come, so itâs really anyoneâs guess, especially in the case of Geralt and Yennefer â at least we know that Ciri will be spending a while hanging out with The Rats, the young group of adventurers we see her with at the end of season 3. On the other hand, if youâre more a spoil-it-for-me type, you could always go read Andrzej Sapkowskiâs Baptism of Fire, the book season 4 is likely to be based on. 
Season 4âs casting also lets us know who fans can expect to show up: Sharlto Copley (known for District 9) will be playing Leo Bonhart, a brutal bounty hunter known for enjoying his work. He has quite a mix-up with Ciri and the Rats in the books. James Purefoy was also announced to be playing Skellen, a court advisor and spy for Emhyr (and the one who hires Bonhart in the books). 
But while those two might be joining the darker sides of The Witcher season 4, thereâs some big casting announcements on Geralt and Ciriâs side as well. Danny Woodburn (Seinfeld) will be playing Zoltan, a dwarf who is a good friend to Geralt. And Laurence Fishburne will be joining The Witcher as Regis, described as âa world-wise Barber-surgeon with a mysterious past who joins Geralt on his journey.â Regis is also first introduced in the novel Baptism by Fire, so the inspiration should seem clear at this point if youâre looking for potential âspoilersâ for what is to come.  (Netflix even describes the plot as if Yen, Ciri, and Geralt âcan embrace and lead the groups of misfits they find themselves in, they have a chance of surviving the baptism of fire â and finding one another again.â)
He has a few movies on the horizon, most immediately two action movies: Argylle, from Kingsman director Matthew Vaughn, and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, directed by Guy Ritchie. Even more enticing, though, is the fact that Cavill is apparently in talks to produce and star in a Warhammer project. Cavill is a massive Warhammer fan, making this a bit of a passion project for him. But since we donât have any details on it yet, it seems much further away.",https://www.polygon.com/23809084/witcher-season-4-release-date-cast-news-liam-hemsworth,2024-04-03 15:41:10
Destiny 2 is getting its two best missions back before The Final Shape,"Destiny 2âs upcoming free update, Into the Light, is truly looking to be a greatest hits collection for the MMO ahead of The Final Shape expansion this June. The variety of beloved and returning weapons revealed on March 26 made that obvious, but it seems Bungie is really pulling out all the stops with some upcoming mission reprisals. During a livestream on Tuesday, Bungie revealed the return of The Whisper and Zero Hour missions to Destiny 2. 
These two Exotic missions are widely considered to be some of the best in the series history, and both were removed from Destiny 2 back in 2020, with the Beyond Light expansion. With Into the Light, both missions will be accessible in the game once again, with Bungie devs promising theyâve twisted some nobs and added new secrets to keep each fresh for players.
Both of these missions were secrets back in their day, requiring a secretive questline or random public event to gain access. They also each heralded the return of a beloved Exotic weapon from the original Destiny â Black Hammer (which became Whisper of the Worm) from The Whisper, and Outbreak Prime (which became Outbreak Perfected) in Zero Hour. 
Based on some gameplay during the livestream, both missions feature the same mix of platforming, combat, and a timer. However, Bungie devs have made some adjustments. The missions themselves will have more enemies to keep up with the increase in power Guardians have seen in recent years, and the timers will be much less restrictive for the missionâs normal difficulty modes. However, for players still looking to challenge themselves, they can dive into higher difficulty versions for stronger enemies and a much tighter timer. 
As for the rewards, both Whisper of the Worm and Outbreak Perfected will become craftable weapons in the update. By completing the mission, Guardians can earn the blueprint, which will allow them to start customizing their Exotics. They can then return to the mission week after week to unlock new perk options and improve the power of their creations.
As for the special ships that came with these missions, neither will be returning via the reprisal â both in an effort to maintain the achievement of old school players and make way for new cosmetics. The revamped Whisper and Zero Hour will have completely new cosmetic ships to earn, with the Zero Hour ship getting a significant overhaul.
As for the rollout of these missions, Bungie will stagger them a bit. The Whisper will appear in-game alongside Into the Light on April 9. Zero Hour and the crafted version of Outbreak Perfected, however, wonât make it into the game until May â just a month ahead of Destiny 2: The Final Shape.
In the stream, Bungie also previewed three new PvP maps coming to the game alongside Into the Light. The maps, the reprised missions, the horde-like Onslaught mode, and the bevy of fan-favorite weapons will all be free for players â regardless of if they own any expansions or seasons. Finally, Bungie left players with a tease, promising new details on The Final Shape expansion via a livestream the morning of April 9, just before Into the Lightâs launch.",https://www.polygon.com/24119354/into-light-whisper-zero-hour-worm-outbreak-final-shape,2024-04-02 21:57:21
Overwatch 2 is allowed to be fun this week,"A new patch for Overwatch 2 rolled out Monday that promises a âreally, really, really balancedâ version of the game. That patch landed on April Foolsâ Day, of course, bringing back googly-eyed heroes and a sweeping set of changes to charactersâ abilities. Itâs a chance for Overwatch 2 players to have a weekâs worth of chaotic fun, and for Blizzard to test out some secretly very good tweaks to the game.
The new Balanced Overwatch mode is only available in the arcade section of Overwatch 2, meaning these changes donât affect Quick Play or Competitive modes â for good reason. Some changes are ridiculous: Relatively new tank Mauga is now 50% smaller, and has just 25 health (down from 525), making him a tiny terror. Conversely, support hero Brigitte is now a full-on tank; sheâs 1.5 times bigger, has an always-massive shield, and got a huge increase to her armor and shield HP.
Some changes are just straight-up silly. Illari becomes solar-powered on any map where the sun is out. Moiraâs Biotic Grasp has been flipped, meaning her healing ability now does damage, and her damage ability now does healing â potentially causing DPS Moiras to actually heal their teammates by mistake. TorbjÃ¶rnâs turrets now stick to anything: walls, ceilings, even other heroes.
Balanced Overwatch also includes some fun new abilities, some of which should actually be in the game. Mei can now summon an ice pillar that launches her into the air. Pharah gets a new ability called Jet Land that lets her dash downward toward the ground while in the air. Reinhardt can reflect incoming fire with his shield, but at the cost of health.
Blizzard has implemented some previous April Foolsâ Day prank changes into the main game. In 2021, Blizzard gave D.Va the ability to crush her enemies when calling in her mech, and gave Zarya a shared cooldown across her two types of bubbles. Those changes ultimately made it into the core modes of Overwatch 2.
More importantly that stealth-introducing actual long term game changes is giving Overwatch 2 players a chance to have fun without the promise of idealistic perfect game balance. Go ahead and win or lose, but have fun, and try to ride on the back of Orisa as Hanzo while youâre at it. Youâll get some free sprays (and lots of XP) for playing.
Balanced Overwatch runs April 1-8, and is accessible from the PLACEHOLDER_TEXT menu in Overwatch 2. You can read about the latest changes in Blizzardâs patch notes below.

X-Men â97âs tribute to Konamiâs X-Men arcade game is 16-bit joy,"X-Men â97 doesnât have to limit itself just to nostalgia for X-Men: The Animated Series. Thatâs the lesson from this weekâs episode, featuring a big tribute to Konamiâs X-Men arcade game, a staple side-scroller of any great â90s arcade. 
Itâs not clear why Roberto Da Costa and Jubilee have been zapped inside a video game in this clip, premiering exclusively on Polygon courtesy of Marvel Animation, but guessing by the title of the episode âMotendo/Lifedeath â Part 1â and the cheeky little âÂ© Motendo 1997â on the gameâs opening screen, it seems likely that this is somewhere in the the Mojoverse, a weird dimension where viewership is everything and ratings equal power. 
You might think that mashing up X-Men: The Animated Series and the X-Men arcade game is barely a mashup at all, but thereâs some fun irony here. Though they came out in the same year, the Konami game wasnât based on the Fox cartoon show at all â but on X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men, a 1989 animated series that never made it past the pilot episode. 
With a couple years distance, Fox took another swing at bringing the X-Men to the small screen with X-Men: The Animated Series. But Konami was already hard at work on its own X-Men arcade game, based on the character designs of Pryde of the X-Men and that showâs core cast: Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Dazzler. 
Is Mojo coming to X-Men â97? The animated series might bring back a classic, if controversial, villain. #xmen97 #xmen #marvel 
Jubilee, who wasnât even created until 1989, did not appear in Konamiâs game. But the Jubilee of the â90s cartoon spent so much time at the arcade in her local mall that she accidentally discovered her powers there â so it makes perfect sense that getting zapped into a video game wouldnât faze her at all. 
You can check out the rest of the episode that this clip comes from on Disney Plus, when âMotendo/Lifedeath â Part 1â premieres on Wednesday, April 3.",https://www.polygon.com/24117894/x-men-97-arcade-game-tribute-mojo-jubilee,2024-04-02 16:00:00

Thereâs a little something for everyone!
Tomb Raider classics Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 2, and Tomb Raider 3 were remastered in February as Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered, and a new entry in the franchise started development in 2022 â no word on a release timeline there.

"Helldivers 2 gets huge level cap increase, new hazards, balance changes","As if in reward for playersâ victorious effort to liberate Malevelon Creek from the Automatons on Monday, Arrowhead Game Studios dropped a fairly significant patch for Helldivers 2 on Tuesday morning with a greatly raised level cap, new planetary hazards, and some significant across-the-board balance changes.
Patch 01.000.200, available now on PlayStation 5 and Steam, raises the level cap from 50 to 150, and adds blizzards and sandstorms to the list of planetary hazards Helldivers might face as they battle in the name of managed democracy.
Potentially of more interest to many players is the list of balance changes. Most â but not all â of the changes seem aimed at making life a little easier. You can read the full patch notes below, but in short: Retrieve Essential Personnel missions have been made easier; Destroy Command Bunkers missions have been made harder; operation modifiers that increase cooldowns have been halved in effect (a very handy buff for all players); and Helldiversâ heavy and medium armor has been made more effective.
Among the weapon balance changes, the Anti-Materiel Rifle, Breaker Incendiary, and Dominator have all had their damage increased, while the Slugger has been nerfed. Various enemy types have been nerfed, too, notably the Charger, Bile Spewer, and Nursing Spewer, but the mighty Bile Titan is now immune to stuns.
There are a few fixes too, including the annoying PS5 bug that would reset save settings when rebooting the game.

Bloody martial arts movie Boy Kills World spawned a real-world fighting game,"When beat-âem-up action-thriller Boy Kills World comes to movie theaters later this month, it will arrive alongside something of a modern rarity: a day-and-date video game tie-in. In the case of Boy Kills World, which stars Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd as the titular Boy and The Raidâs Yayan Ruhian as his martial arts mentor, the licensed game is Super Dragon Punch Force 3, an original fighting game based on the film.
Adding to the uniqueness of the tie-in, Super Dragon Punch Force 3 serves as the fictional follow-up to a video game in the film, Super Dragon Punch Force 2 â the game that SkarsgÃ¥rdâs character, who becomes deaf during the events of the movie, bases his inner voice on. For the real-life sequel, Super Dragon Punch Force 3âs creators are aiming for more than just a promotional tie-in. Theyâre developing the game to be competitive and regularly updated.
Super Dragon Punch Force 3 will be released on Windows PC and mobile platforms on April 26 in an open beta. Itâs the debut title from Talent Digital Art, a developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa. The fighting gameâs roster includes some of the movieâs leads, including SkarsgÃ¥rdâs Boy and Jessica Rotheâs June 27, alongside a handful of others. The gameplay trailer for SDFP3 shows off characters SK, Yazya, Marlo, Jace, and Deb as part of the roster.
Talent Digital Art was founded in 2019, the studioâs creative director, Matthew-Judd Fitzjohn, told Polygon in an interview. The developer got access to the script for Boy Kills World and thought, Fitzjohn said, âwouldnât it be such a cool opportunity if we were to deepen the experience and immersion of this universe by actually building out the really cool sounding but fake game in the film.â
âItâs really about letting each thing be its own thing,â he explained, âbut hopefully giving the consumer or at least someone whoâs going to watch both the film and play the game â and we encourage you to do both â a deeper feeling experience in terms of the world weâre trying to create.â
The goal, TDA CEO Tanya Brits said, is âto create games that are effortlessly enjoyableâ and to express the identity and interests of its multicultural South African team. âWe wanted to give ourselves enough creative freedom where we can develop really cool fighting mechanics that are difficult to master, but also make sure that the game is easy to get into,â Brits said.
Super Dragon Punch Force 3 is designed to be pick up and play, Fitzjohn said, and is free to play. âOur hope and desire for the game is really just to open it up to people that might not necessarily be able to experience fighting games, because maybe the box price is just a little too steep,â Fitzjohn said.
The developers behind SDPF3 are also aiming for depth. 
âWeâve been really passionate about partnering with the [fighting game community] in building this out,â Fitzjohn said. âAnd theyâre such a wonderful community, super passionate, but also just so willing to give their feedback, both the local members of the FGC but also international members.
âWeâre trying to maintain a level of technicality that encourages you to spend time with the character and get to know them, but also presenting all the mechanics in a way that I can jump straight in with [friends] and just bash some buttons and have some fun.â
The story of Boy Kills World, the movie, sends SkarsgÃ¥rdâs Boy on a quest for vengeance against Famke Janssenâs Hilda Van Der Koy, who is described by the filmâs creators as a âderanged matriarch of a corrupt post-apocalyptic dynasty.â Guided by Yayan Ruhianâs shaman character, Boy battles Van Der Koyâs henchmen in hyper-violent martial arts battles and aligns himself with a resistance group. The movie also stars Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey), Sharlto Copley (District 9), Andrew Koji (Warrior), and H. Jon Benjamin (as Boyâs inner voice).
Boy Kills World comes to theaters on April 26. Super Dragon Punch Force 3 is expected to be available in an open beta form the same day on Steam and mobile app stores.",https://www.polygon.com/24118252/boy-kills-world-game-super-dragon-force-punch-3,2024-04-02 13:05:00
"Helldivers 2 players get revenge on Automatons, take back Malevelon Creek","After a brutal defeat at Malevelon Creek in early March, the Helldivers have apparently gotten some much-needed redemption. On Monday, Helldivers 2 players received a major order to liberate Malevelon Creek from the Automaton menace, and within hours, they won.
The major order gave players 24 hours to liberate the planet, which was still under the control of the Automatonsâ âillegal occupationâ after the previous defeat. And a success would net all players 35 medals â a decent reward for a short major order like this one. The developers knew this would rile up the player base too, with the following text:
Several weeks ago, our citizens watched in horror as Malevelon Creek fell to the Automatons. Millions of valiant heroes perished attempting to defend it. For too long, the bots have maintained their illegal occupation, desecrating the memory of the fallen by rapidly depleting the planetâs exceptionally rich rhodium deposits. This travesty will be allowed to continue no longer.
Take vengeance and honor our heroes. End the theft of valuable minerals. Liberate Malevelon Creek.
Since that initial defeat, âMalevelon Creekâ has become a shorthand within the Helldivers community for trauma and loss â  the communityâs âRobot Vietnam,â as itâs been called. Iâve seen videos of people (jokingly) breaking down at the mere mention of the planet. The original attack was rough, as players got steamrolled by the Automatons. People were taken off guard by how different it was to fight them than the Terminids, and how difficult some of the enemy types were to destroy. 
The previous fight was among the first battles with the Automatons after the game launched, and it was the player baseâs first major loss after successfully liberating planets from Terminid bugs. The game tasked players with going back to Terminid missions after the failure before ordering them to return to Automaton space last week. That resulted in the loss of Tibit, home to many manufacturing facilities in the Helldivers universe.
As of approximately two hours ago, major combat operations in Malevelon Creek have ended. In the battle of Malevelon Creek, we are proud to announce, Super Earth and our allies have prevailed.April 1st will forever be a day of victory and remembrance. Hold the line, Helldivers! pic.twitter.com/kkigdQTCm9
Whatâs next for Helldivers 2? The success is just the start of another major order issued Monday, which specifies that players have to liberate three planets in the Severin Sector: Malevelon Creek, Draupnir, and Ubanea (at the time of this writing, only Ubanea is still under Automaton control). Players on Reddit have also spotted what appear to be massive cloaked ships over Automaton planets.
Although this all begs the question: Is this real? It is April Foolsâ Day, after all, and with the revelation that a game master named âJoelâ is moving the tides of the war in real-time, you have to wonder if this is going to blow up in everybodyâs faces. Also, why did the Automatons fall so easily this time? Was it because players now have strategies to succeed in those fights or did the developers do something to make them less challenging? If the major orders and events since Helldivers 2âs launch have been any indication, the developers like to have fun with the player base, and anything can happen.

All the House of the Dragon season 2 news weâve heard so far,"Much like with Game of Thrones, the end of House of the Dragon season 1 has been met with a common refrain: When is season 2? Thankfully, HBO has been a bit more transparent with plans for House of the Dragon season 2 â starting by confirming that there definitely will be one. This is not quite a âYou know nothing, Jon Snowâ situation.
Hereâs the latest news, release info, and plot details on House of the Dragon season 2. Expect updates, cast shake-ups, and boasting about dragons. And maybe George R.R. Martin with a few words of hype. (But if youâre looking for updates on when The Winds of Winter will be out, godspeed. Remember, only 500 pages to go.)

    Related
  
House of the Dragon received a second-season greenlight way back in August 2022, after its first episode. Twenty million viewers of the premiere across all platforms was enough to prove that Game of Thrones fever hadnât diminished since the 2019 finale of the flagship series. But HBO is known for taking its time between the first and second seasons of some of its biggest shows. So itâs no surprise that getting a release date took a while. Thankfully, HBO has revealed that House of the Dragon season 2 will be released on June 17. 
It was not impacted, according to Martin himself. Martin wrote on his not-a-blog website that he supports the strikes and that the writerâs room of the upcoming Game of Thrones-spinoff A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight is on hiatus until the strike is over. However, scripts for season 2 of House of the Dragon have already been complete for some time, so production on the series will commence as planned. 
While HBO has yet to confirm the actor lineup for season 2, George R.R. Martinâs source material suggests that future seasons wonât be taking the kind of leaps in time that defined season 1. So expect Matt Smith as Daemon, Olivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower, Emma DâArcy as Rhaenyra, Steve Toussaint as Corlys Velaryon, Eve Best as Rhaenys, Tom Glynn-Carney as Aegon II, and Ewan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen to all be back and ready to clash.
As for new characters, Martin has already confirmed one: Daeron Targaryen, Viserys and Alicentâs fourth child, who was apparently down in Oldtown throughout season 1 and âwe just did not have the time to work him in this season,â Martin said in a blog from early October.
Besides the cast members who aged out or died over the course of season 1, the major absences going into House of the Dragon season 2 is actually behind the camera: Miguel Sapochnik, the Thrones mainstay director who stepped up to co-run House of the Dragon with writer Ryan Condal, announced in late August that he would not return for season 2. Instead, another Thrones veteran, Alan Taylor, has stepped in to take on the role of producer-director of season 2.
Readers of Martinâs fictional-history book Fire & Blood know where things are going, but letâs just say we expect lots of green, lots of black, and lots of dragon war. As for specifics of season 2, the final episodes suggest the action will expand beyond the walls of Kingâs Landing back to familiar territory around Westeros. Showrunner Ryan Condal says the second season will feature five new dragons, which could hint at a specific Fire & Blood plot leading up to the Targaryen civil war. 
Want a deeper dive? Beware of mild spoilers:
What House of the Dragonâs Dance of the Dragons means for the showâs future 
The key thing Martin has revealed in anticipation of the season 1 finale was just how long he, Condal, and HBO intended to keep the Targaryen history churning. In a blog, Martin specified that the current plan is four seasons total, with three more depicting the epic war that will shape the Westeros fans know from Game of Thrones (although it may also be an entirely different one). Martin confirmed that each season would receive 10 one-hour episodes.
While we wait patiently for House of the Dragon to return we... also wait patiently for the handful of other Westeros adventures currently in development at HBO. Whatâs on the docket? Thereâs that Jon Snow series that Kit Harington is dying to make; and Ten Thousand Ships, a prequel set 1,000 years before Thrones that will tell the story of Princess Nymeria, the founder of Dorne. 
One series thatâs been officially announced is A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight, an adaptation of Martinâs Dunk & Egg stories, which tell the tales of legendary knight Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg, aka Aegon V Targaryen. This series will take place more than 100 years before the events of the main Game of Thrones series and does not yet have a release date.

All the Gen V season 2 news weâve heard so far ,"Gen Vâs first season has come to a climactic and bloody end, but that doesnât mean the story is over for the students of God U. But now that the season is over, itâs time to look ahead at whatâs next for The Boysâ first spinoff series. 
Thankfully, we already know some of the most important stuff about Gen Vâs second season, but there are still plenty of questions to be answered. Hereâs everything we know about season 2 of Gen V, and a few things we have questions about. 
[Ed. note: Spoilers for Gen V season 1 follow.]
Gen V is definitely getting a second season. In fact, season 2 was announced just a few weeks after the show premiered, as it quickly rocketed to the top of Prime Videoâs charts. 
Gen V season 2 doesnât have a release date yet, and while it was expected sometime in 2025, it could be a little later than that after the tragic death of star Chance Perdomo. It was announced that there will be an indefinite delay in the shooting of the second season both to grieve the loss of Perdomo and for the writers to decide how to proceed with the series without him. 
Perdomo died in a motorcycle accident on March 30. He was the only person involved in the accident. The star of Gen V and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina was 27 years old. 
What happens in Gen V season 2 is a very interesting question. The show canât return to Godolkin University, considering how season 1 ends, which means it will have to evolve completely for its return. But considering how good most of season 1 is, that transformation should be exciting to see. 
One thing that seems almost certain is that our heroes from season 1 will be divided when the show comes back, with Sam and Cate on one side and Jordan, Marie, and Emma on the other. The latter group ends the season as Voughtâs prisoners, so theyâll have to figure their way out of that particular conundrum before even considering how to deal with their former friends (a plotline that might be influenced by whatever developments we get in The Boys season 4, which comes on June 13, 2024). One character we donât know the future of his Andre. 
With the passing of Chance Perdomo, who played Andre, itâs not clear yet whether the character will return for season 2. Itâs possible the writers of the show will opt to recast the role, or they may write him out of the series instead. 
You absolutely should. The Boys is obviously important to Gen Vâs plot, especially considering where the first season ends and the cameos therein, but itâs also likely that The Boys will return to Prime Video before Gen V does, so youâll have something to watch between seasons. 
The answer to this incredibly specific question is: yes, there is! Invincible, also on Prime Video, starts its second season on Nov. 3, which means Gen Vâs season 1 finale practically leads right into it. Invincible shares bits and pieces of its DNA with The Boys, in that itâs also a violent and gory superhero show, but itâs also a coming-of-age story for a young superhero in a different mode than Gen Vâs. In other words, Invincible is the perfect show to pick up if youâre still looking for a bit of superhero action in your television while you wait for The Boys and Gen V to return.

Legoâs $299.99 Gotham Skyline inspired by Batman: The Animated Series launches today,"While Lego has plenty of products featuring the various iterations of Batman, its latest set based on Batman: The Animated Series might be their best yet. The massive 4,210-piece set will set you back $299.99 when it becomes widely available on April 4. However, members of the free-to-join Lego Insiders program are able to purchase the set starting April 1.  
Besides serving as a vehicle for the astounding voice talents of Mark Hamill and the late Kevin Conroy, Batman: The Animated Series was an afternoon staple that had a profound impact on how we experienced pop culture for anyone who spent our formative years steeped in 90âs animation. This era in Batman animation also delivered us one of the best Batman movies to date, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
It's a well-known fact that dads love Batman, and thereâs no Batman better than Kevin Conroyâs Batman from the â90s cartoon. The Lego version of the Gotham skyline from the animated series that shaped a generation features a total of 4,210 pieces and includes minifigs of the Joker, Harley, Catwoman, and naturally, the Dark Knight.
Just like many other licensed Lego sets, the Gotham Skyline set is full of sly winks and references for fans of the animated series. The crimson Gotham skyline is punctuated with police airships, the Batwing, and, naturally, a massive Bat Signal calling the Caped Crusader to action. At street level, youâll find a collection of some of Gothamâs most infamous locations, like the Gotham Opera, the Ace Chemical Plant, and Arkham Asylum. 
Parts of the setâs facade can even be removed to reveal daguerreotype pieces that highlight some of the most famous (and infamous) escapades of the Dark Knight and the Rogues Gallery.
The set also features Wayne Manor, complete with the subterranean Batcave concealed underneath that houses a removable, miniature model of the Batmobile.
To complete the set, Lego has included four unique minifigs of  Batman, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, and the Joker perched on a gargoyle-laden parapet.
Update (April 1): The article was changed to mention the Batman Lego set's availability for Lego Insiders members.",https://www.polygon.com/deals/24093341/lego-batman-gotham-skyline-animated-series-launch-release,2024-04-01 14:57:23

"Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice Leagueâs new Joker is here, and players arenât laughing","Rocksteady Studiosâ Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League got a shot in the arm Thursday with the release of its first season, which notably brings the Joker back to the franchiseâs Arkhamverse. Joker is a newly playable character, plucked from an alternate-reality Elseworld, who joins the Suicide Squad on their mission to kill a bunch of alternate-reality Braniacs.
Players who have stuck with Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League for the past two months and are now getting their first taste of Rocksteadyâs DLC plans donât seem too happy with how the Joker has rolled out. Unlocking him requires more of the same grind that Kill the Justice League has been criticized for, and thereâs very little new narratively to renew interest in the game, players say.
Kill the Justice Leagueâs Joker is free to acquire, though players can spend a premium currency known as Luthor Coins to unlock him faster. For players who donât want to pay, theyâll need to play the gameâs repetitive missions for a couple hours to unlock Joker. By doing so, they get a new playable character with a new talent tree to fill out and Jokerâs unique style of traversal. In action, Joker looks pretty fun.
But story-wise, players get only an animated intro explaining Jokerâs world and Brainiacâs invasion, and a cutscene introducing him to Amanda Wallerâs Task Force X. Thereâs a bit more background tucked into the Batman Experience interactive exhibition in Metropolis, which is interesting, but based on heated player response to the new additions, itâs not enough to satisfy Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League fans.
Feedback from players on Steam and the gameâs subreddit has been swift and largely angry. Players are complaining about having to grind new levels, called Fear episode rank, and repeat a boss fight. As in the original game, players will have to defeat a version of Brainiac based on a pre-existing boss; instead of fighting a version of Brainiac mimicking the Flash, this time theyâll face a Brainiac who uses Green Lanternâs boss mechanics. Itâs more repetition in a game already infamous for its monotonous tasks.
Season 1 also offers a cosmetically modified version of Metropolis, one thatâs corrupted with nice-looking Joker imagery. But those new additions, new Incursions missions, cosmetics, and gear simply arenât enough for players to come around to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice Leagueâs offerings.
âItâs absolutely fair to say that this season was make or break for this game,â one player on the gameâs subreddit complained. âI was hoping for some new missions or some additions to the story [but] instead itâs just added a new character you either grind for or buy and nothing more, no story, no new missions, no new content, there is nothing different besides new Riddler crap and some reskinned buildings. I really wanted this game to do well and I believed it could but this was just disappointing and probably killed it.â
âSo Rocksteady wants us to grind the same old missions, get bored of them all over again, just for the privilege of experiencing the main reason people came back (the Joker), and continue grinding those same missions you just got bored of again,â said another. âYeah no thanks.â
Part of this angry knee-jerk reaction seems to be that these are the players who have loved Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League the most â or at least those who have stuck with it longer than the rest â and they want to see Rocksteady succeed with it. Those players want the other three promised playable characters to come out, and for the gameâs story to grow. But tepid response to the game and low player counts spell doom for Kill the Justice League as a long-supported live-service game. Jokerâs release and season 1âs content offerings donât inspire confidence. (On Steam at least, the game has seen an uptick in players, with thousands of concurrent users playing the PC version compared to hundreds earlier this week.)
Thereâs still more coming in season 1, however. Rocksteady describes this weekâs launch as part one of a two-episode season. Still to come are new weapons inspired by villains like Two-Face, Reverse Flash, and Black Manta, as well as new infused enemy types, and another Brainiac battle, this one modeled after the main gameâs Superman boss fight. Whether any of that is received more warmly by Suicide Squad fans remains to be seen. But thereâs little reason to be hopeful.

"Figmaâs premium Link action figure can Ascend, just like in TOTK","Good Smileâs Figma is taking pre-orders for its multitalented action figure based on Link from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for the Nintendo Switch. This 5.9-inch âLink DXâ figure costs $115.99 at the Good Smile U.S. shop and wonât be out until March 2025, but it should be worth the wait â and the money. Other retailers are accepting pre-orders, but at a higher cost, in case Good Smile sells through its pre-order supply.
Just like in the game, this Link action figure has a whole bag of tricks. It ships with goodies like the Master Sword, King Rauruâs right arm, a Construct Bow and arrow, a rock fused to a stick, and a Zonai rocket, among several other bits and bobs. My favorite feature is that Link can be split at the torso and stuck onto a circular pad, evoking his fun Ascend ability from the game, which lets him magically travel upwards through hard surfaces to reach higher ground.
This Link figure can strike numerous poses youâll often see in the game, thanks to its assortment of accessories. Better yet, Linkâs face can be swapped out so his emotion matches his actions. Youâll get standard, smiling, and shouting face plates. With the included stand, Link can appear to be shooting up to the Sky layer with a Zonai rocket fused onto his shield, dangling from his paraglider, or posed to be swinging down hard on some unsuspecting fool with the Rock Hammer. Those are just some of the possibilities.
I canât think of a better gift to oneself, or to another Zelda fan than this customizable figure. But, if $149.99 is (understandably) outside of your budget, Figma is making a $69.99 version thatâs just as detailed, but ships with fewer accessories.

Dragonâs Dogma 2âs first patch lets you start a new game without deleting your save first,"The first patch for Dragonâs Dogma 2 is officially out on PlayStation 5 and Steam. In additional to a handful of new graphical settings, it adds the option to start a new save file and increases the number of âArt of Metamorphosisâ tomes (which allow you to change your characterâs appearance) in the game. You can see the full patch notes here. A patch for the Xbox Series X version of the game is planned for the coming days.
Originally, Dragonâs Dogma 2 only offered a single save slot, meaning players who wanted to start the game again â perhaps to try a different specialization â could only do so by manually deleting their save file at the system level first. The process is fiddly, involving disabling cloud saving and, for Steam players, actually locating their game save on the hard drive.
Capcom initially said it would add âthe option to start a new game when save data already existsâ as part of the first wave of updates to Dragonâs Dogma 2. This doesnât mean it actually added a second save slot for a new character; the update simply made it easy to overwrite your save from within the game itself.
Capcom also said it added a frame rate cap of 30 frames per second to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game.At a base level, the game runs with an uncapped frame rate, meaning it can sometimes run faster than 30 fps, but this can result in inconsistent and juddery performance (especially for players without variable refresh rate displays). A 30 fps cap should ensure a more consistent and stable feel to the game, though itâs only available on PS5 at the moment..
Capcom also added options to disable the motion blur and ray tracing graphical effects to console versions of Dragonâs Dogma 2, but it warned that doing so âwill not affect the frame rate significantly.â Frame rate improvements will come in âfuture updates,â it said. PC players will now get better-quality results from the DLSS.
Previously in very limited supply, the stock of the âArt of Metamorphosisâ item is being increased to 99 at Pawn Guilds. This change appears to be targeted at criticism of the gameâs microtransactions, which include the sale of âArt of Metamorphosisâ at $1.99. With this change, it will only be inability to afford the in-game price that would push players toward paying real money to change the looks of their character or Main Pawn. (No changes were announced for other rare items available to buy as microtransactions, such as Wakestones or portcrystals.)
Other changes make it easier to acquire your own house earlier in the game, as well as various text display and bug fixes.
Capcom said it would release the updates âas soon as they are ready for distribution on each platform.â

Embracer has sold Gearbox â and Borderlands â to Take-Two for $460M,"Troubled gaming conglomerate Embracer announced Thursday that it has agreed to sell Gearbox Entertainment, the studio behind the Borderlands games, to Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two for $460 million.
The deal makes a lot of sense; Take-Two has been the publisher for Borderlands through its 2K Games label since long before Gearbox was acquired by Embracer in 2021. In its press release, 2K said the next Borderlands game was in active development at Gearbox.
As part of the deal, Take-Two acquires the Borderlands franchise and its spinoff series Tiny Tinaâs Wonderlands, as well as the Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms, and Duke Nukem series. The studios acquired by Take-Two are the Gearbox Software mothership in Frisco, Texas, as well as Gearbox MontrÃ©al and Gearbox Studio Quebec.
âAs a significant long-term Embracer Group shareholder, I believe in the strategy for the Embracer Group going forward and am completely convinced that this transaction is the best possible scenario and an obvious net positive arrangement for Embracer Group, for Take-Two and, of course, for Gearbox Entertainment,â said Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford. âMy primary interest is always Gearbox, including our talent and our customers. I want to personally ensure fans of our games that this arrangement will ensure that the experiences we have in development at Gearbox will be the best it can possibly be.â
Embracer is hanging on to a few parts of the Gearbox empire: Gearbox Publishing San Francisco (which well be renamed), including the publishing rights to the Remnant games and Hyper Light Breaker; Cryptic Studios, the massively multiplayer specialist, with its games Neverwinter Online and Star Trek Online; and support studios Lost Boys Interactive and Captured Dimensions. 
Though Gearbox Publishing San Francisco is still under Embracer, the company confirmed to Polygon that it has laid off an unspecified number of employees ânot tied to the developmentâ of Gearbox games. The layoffs appear to impact marketing, communications, and other portions of the company.
âThe Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games,â a spokesperson told Polygon. âThank you for granting us the space to remain focused on our people and in our handling of the situation with compassion and manage the process, balancing between our present duty and a commitment to our future.â
For Embracer, the sale of Gearbox â one of its most prized assets â is the next step in a deep cost-cutting and restructuring process the company began last year after a reported $2 billion deal fell through. As part of its restructuring, Embracer laid off at least 900 people. Prior to its financial difficulties, the Swedish group, which began life as Nordic Games, had been on a wild acquisition spree that included the purchase of board game giant Asmodee, Square Enixâs Western studios and franchises including Tomb Raider, and the media rights for The Lord of the Rings. 
Embracer also announced Thursday that it had completed the sale of another of its biggest studio groups, Saber Interactive, which it acquired in 2020. Saberâs founder Matthew Karch bought back the main Saber Interactive studio and several subsidiaries for $247 million, while Embracer retained Metro developer 4A Games, Aspyr, and others. Saber has the right to acquire 4A and pinball specialist Zen Studios within a certain time period, although publishing rights for the Metro games will stay with Embracerâs subsidiary Plaion. Saber is reportedly still collaborating with Embracer on the troubled remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.
Update: This story has been updated to include news concerning layoffs at Gearbox Publishing, along with a statement from the company. ",https://www.polygon.com/24114399/embracer-gearbox-borderlands-take-two-2k-sale,2024-03-28 19:29:37
Dropoutâs new show Smartypants is bringing PowerPoint parties to your screen,"Comedy streaming service Dropout is back at it with a new series thatâs set to capitalize on the PowerPoint party trend that flourished during the pandemic and on TikTok.
Smartypants, hosted by Rekha Shankar, will feature a number of guests from Dropoutâs rotating stable of performers, each of whom will present a PowerPoint on a topic â any topic. Examples shown in the trailer include âDo vegetables really exist?â, âWhich cryptid is the chillest to blaze with?â, and âThe United States government should build me a Gundam.â Theyâre all topics that fit in well with its high-class, academic setting. 
The first season features 10 episodes and will premiere on April 25, with episodes releasing every other week on Thursdays. 
Smartypantsâ guest list â and members of the âSmartypants Societyâ â includes faces that will be familiar to fans of the service, including Katie Marovitch, Erika Ishii, Mike Trapp, Paul F. Tompkins, Jacob Wysocki, Demi Adejuyigbe, Vic Michaelis, and many others. 
PowerPoint parties have been thriving as a way for people to come together and do some friendly public speaking on sometimes extremely dumb topics that they can turn into easily-presentable slideshows. They were popular during the pandemic since they could be done virtually, but theyâve also gone viral on TikTok. The format has also been used in live comedy shows for podcasters, standup comedians, and others.
The company now known as Dropout has been host to a number of popular web series over the years, starting back in the day when it was known as CollegeHumor. Some favorites include nerdy, traditional game show Um, Actually, chaotic game show Game Changer, and Dungeons & Dragons live play show Dimension 20.

MLB The Show update accidentally makes players look like bobbleheads,"Baseball season has officially begun: Itâs opening day for Major League Baseball. MLB The Show 24, which was released on March 15, celebrated the milestone with an update that went live Thursday morning. Itâs, uh, not going well. People on social media and in forums are reporting major issues that make the game unplayable â like frequent crashing and freezing. And then thereâs the bugs that are just downright silly, like one particularly funny one thatâs causing some players to have big heads and little bodies.
An MLB The Show representative posted from the gameâs X (formerly Twitter) account on Thursday, noting that the developer is âaware of the current issues and working to get them resolved.â
We are aware of the current issues and working to get them resolved. Thank you for your patience.
A lot of the problems seem to be with the Diamond Dynasty feature, which is basically the baseball version of EA Sports FCâs Ultimate Team, where you collect players via cards to create a team. There are different modes within Diamond Dynasty, including ranked multiplayer and single-player mini seasons.
The gameâs had its fair share of issues since release â particularly on the Nintendo Switch â but the latest update seems to have caused even more problems. For a lot of players, MLB The Show 24 looks a lot more like Backyard Baseball or Super Mega Baseball than anything else.

"Red vs. Blueâs finale movie is still coming out, despite Rooster Teeth closing","Rooster Teeth may have been shuttered by Warner Bros. a few weeks ago, but that doesnât mean that Red vs. Blue is going away. The Halo-based machinima web series that started 21 years ago is still getting its previously announced final season, despite its production company being shuttered. The trailer for the last season debuted on Thursday, revealing a release date of May 7.
The trailer brings back the seriesâ iconic characters for one final mission and a few last jokes â along with plenty of callbacks to the earlier seasons, it seems. The trailerâs YouTube description also comes with a slightly more revealing plot description: 
When the universeâs greatest villain returns in a terrifying new form, old adversaries, the Reds and Blues of Blood Gulch, will have to set aside their differences to save the galaxy one last time.
Red vs. Blue: Restoration brings series co-creator Burnie Burns, who stepped away from the show four years ago, back as a writer; alongside director Matt Hullum. The seriesâ main cast will also return, including Geoff Ramsey, Gus Sorola, and more.

"Sega Europe laying off 240 workers, selling off Company of Heroes developer Relic","Sega Europe announced Thursday that itâs selling off Company of Heroes 3 and Age of Empires 4 developer Relic Entertainment while cutting approximately 240 jobs across several other Sega Europe studios.
Relic Entertainment confirmed that itâs going independent with the help of an external investor; under this new structure, itâll continue to support Company of Heroes 3 and its next update coming in April. âThis is a huge change for us, but one thing does not change: we want to create amazing experiences for our players,â read a post on the companyâs X account (formerly Twitter). Segaâs shares of Relic were transferred to a holding company that is âto be newly established by the UK investment company Emona Capital,â according to Segaâs financial disclosures. Emona Capital is also invested in Amber, a game development services company; it invested $20 million into that company in 2022.

In its final disclosure statement, Sega Europe said that itâs laying off 240 people âwith the aim of optimizing fixed expenses.â Impacted studios include Sega Europe, Creative Assembly, and Sega Hardlight, according to GamesIndusty.biz. Sega Europe expects to record roughly $10 million, or 1.5 billion yen, in losses related to the âbusiness restructuring.â These layoffs follow cuts at Sega in 2023, when the company canceled Hyenas, a shooter from Creative Assembly. Two hundred fifty people were laid off at that time, Sega Europe confirmed in Thursdayâs statement. In the seven months since Hyenasâ cancellation, that means around 500 people have been laid off from Sega. Thatâs on top of 121 redundancies at Relic Entertainment in May 2023.
Polygon has reached out to Sega Europe for comment.
Sega Europe blamed its restructuring on a âreactionary decline from the stay-at-home demand in COVID-19 and the economic downturn due to inflation, which led to lowered profitability for the company. Experts told Polygon earlier this year that there was record growth during the pandemic, creating a âcollective delusionâ that the growth would hold forever. It didnât, and the industry is back to incremental growth as executives rode short-term gains over long-term sustainability. That, plus other shifts the business of video games, have contributed to the period of volatility thatâs currently straining the industryâs workers. Industry trackers put the number people laid off from the video game industry in 2024 at over 8,000. More than 10,000 people were laid off in 2023.
This is all in contrast an announcement Sega of America workers made yesterday: The Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS) voted Tuesday to ratify their first collective bargaining agreement with Sega. The group of around 150 workers won base raises for all employees, layoff protections, and improved crediting to game developers. Another major win for the union is just cause protections; California, where the Sega of America office is located, is an at-will employment state, meaning companies can fire employees for any reasons, as long as it doesnât violate workplace protections against discrimination and other laws. Just cause protections require the employer to follow guidelines to prove there is a âjust causeâ to let someone go. Sega of America laid off dozens of workers earlier this year â before the union contract was ratified â and AEGIS was able to negotiate to save some jobs.

"The Adult Swim Games delisting situation is strange, even to lawyers","Video games get delisted often, mostly for banal reasons like an expired music licensing agreement or a publishing agreement running out. But the recent delisting of Adult Swim Games en masse feels a bit different. 
This isnât a licensing issue, nor is it the case of a live service game no longer making enough money to cover the cost of running it. According to Brandon Huffman, an attorney with Odin Law and Media and volunteer counsel for the International Game Developersâ Association, itâs actually unclear why Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of Adult Swim, would work to delist the games at all. 
âSo those sorts of situations happen, but for a publisher to delist, sort of systematically, their whole catalog over time â or what seems like is eventually going to happen, to delist their whole catalog over time? Thatâs not a rights issue at all,â he said in a call with Polygon. 
Starting in the beginning of March, a number of independent game developers reported that they had received correspondence from Warner Bros. Discovery saying that their games would be removed from digital storefronts. The first mention of this online came from developer Owen Deery, who posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the company was âretiringâ his game Small Radios Big Televisions. He then made the Windows PC version free to download through a self-hosted website. Others have since come forward saying that they received a similar notice from the company. 
However, just self-hosting an older game is easier said than done. For one thing, the developers that worked with Adult Swim Games didnât all have identical agreements. For example, Rayâs the Dead developer Ragtag Studio received significant funding from Adult Swim Games to get its project across the finish line, but this didnât come with any other strings attached, so Ragtag published the game itself. Huffman, whoâs been working with people affected by the situation, said heâs seen a few publishing agreements, but each one had different terms. So itâs possible not every creator will be able to repost their games. 
More significantly, giving the developer freedom to post the game on their own on a platform like Steam, while simple logistically, can wipe out years of data. Discussions, reviews, wishlists, and more wonât transfer to a new page. All of this is also key to preserving a gameâs history, according to Phil Salvador, library director at Video Game History Foundation.
âPreserving game history is also about more than preserving the game itself. Removing Steam listings also deletes the communities that have existed for these games, in some cases for more than a decade,â he told Polygon in an email. 
Then thereâs the other disclaimer: Developers have to remove any mention of Adult Swim from the game itself. And, as Salvador noted, what happens âif the developers no longer have their source codeâ? Many of these games are more than a decade old and havenât received updates in years. 
Michael Molinari, who released 2013âs Soundodger+ through Adult Swim Games, told Polygon in early March that he was told to âremove any and all mention of Adult Swim Gamesâ â including the names of people who were with the Adult Swim team and were listed in the credits, which is another huge problem for game preservation. âIâm a huge supporter of games preservation, and this is a direct blow to properly crediting the people that worked on a game,â he said.
Itâs possible to transfer ownership of a Steam page, but that requires all parties, including Valve Software, to be in on the conversation. Itâs theoretically easy to do â just a few clicks with the help of Steamâs transfer page â but you need either Warner Bros. Discovery to transfer it over or, according to Huffman, you need to prove to Valve that youâre the owner and have somebody over there transfer the page (âwhich they have no obligation to do,â Huffman added).
Unfortunately, itâs been tough to figure out who to even contact at Warner Bros. Discovery. Adult Swim as a whole is in a precarious place compared to its height starting in the mid-2000s, and the games division specifically went through layoffs and restructuring back when the entire WarnerMedia brand was owned by AT&T. In 2020, Big Pixel Studios, developer of Pocket Mortys and Adult Swim Gamesâ first acquisition, was shut down as part of those efforts. And because Adult Swim Games is working off a skeleton crew according to a couple sources (the official website still lists 2020âs Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time as âcoming soonâ), itâs difficult to find anybody to talk to.
âIâve talked to a couple developers who donât know who their contact person to get the rights back would be, because itâs such a big company,â Huffman said. âAnd so navigating at this point, If I want out of this, how do I get out of it? Who do I call? That in and of itself is not clear to them.â
The lingering question, though, is: Why? Why bother delisting the games at all? There are no administrative fees involved with listing a game on a platform like Steam, minus having to pay Valve a percentage of sales. If these games have been around so long that theyâre not making much money anymore, then it wouldnât cost Warner Bros. Discovery much at all to keep them up. 
âThe likelihood that a publisher delists a game is very low because as soon as you delist the game, you stop making money off of it,â Huffman said. âAnd so, if a game is being delisted, it must be, in theory, making so little money that the burden of writing the check to the developer is too much administrative cost, or something bigger is going on.â
Not every impacted developer has announced their game will be delisted yet, but the expectation is that those notices will come in. Warner Bros. Discovery has yet to fully announce its future games strategy beyond statements regarding the proliferation of popular IP like Harry Potter, but the future of indies at the studio â and for Adult Swim Games as a whole â will become clearer over the coming months.
âThis is not the first time that developers have been screwed by publishers, and it wonât be the last time,â Huffman said.

Donât Starve is getting a board game spin-off,"The beloved survival game Donât Starve is being adapted into a board game. Glass Cannon Unplugged, a studio known for creating tabletop renditions of other series like Frostpunk and Diablo, will lead creation of Donât Starve: The Board Game in partnership with the original video game developer, Klei Entertainment. The game is set to launch via a Kickstarter campaign ânear the end of the 3rd quarter in 2024,â a release said. 
Donât Starve: The Board Game is being designed by part of the team behind Frostpunk: The Board Game. RafaÅ PieczyÅski, lead developer of the Frostpunk: The Board Game, is designing the Donât Starve adaptation. Jakub WiÅniewski (designer on the board game version of This War Of Mine) and Natanel Vo-Apfel (Into The Outside: Prelude) will also provide narrative direction on the game. You can check out more details on Donât Starve: The Board Game on the Kickstarter page. 
The original Donât Starve follows a scientist named Wilson who suddenly finds himself in a dark, grim world called the Constant. The gameplay pairs fast-paced roguelike mechanics with survival gameplay elements like building and crafting. The series is known for its quirky but dark world and unique 2D art style that almost looks like a Tim Burton movie. Since its debut in 2013, Donât Starve has become a staple for survival gaming fans, and Klei Entertainment has continued to release DLC for the game and updates more than ten years after its release. 
Each game in Donât Starve: The Board Game will take approximately 60 to 90 minutes to play and will allow for 1-4 players. According to the developers, the gameâs visual design will fully embrace âthe unique, whimsical art style long cherished by fans of the series.â Players will assume the role of characters from the video game as they work together to outsmart the elements and fight to survive against the Constantâs large assortment of monsters. The board gameâs mechanics will highlight aspects of the source material like âplayer choice, dynamic combat, and open-world exploration in night and day conditions,â the release said. 
According to the press release, this board game wonât be the end of it. The team also plans to offer additional content via âexpansions, add-ons and future retail releases.â So if youâve got the itch to be eaten alive by a monster, well, youâll have plenty of opportunities to do so.

"Sega of America workers ratify union contract, protecting 150 employees","Workers at Sega of America voted Tuesday to ratify their first collectively-bargained contract with the U.S. arm of the video game company, granting new protections and raises for about 150 full-time and temporary employees. 
Workers in the union, known as Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS), won important concessions from Sega of America as part of the contract, including base-building raises for all employees, layoff protections, and a commitment to crediting people on games theyâve worked on, including early QA testers. It also affords employees in the union other protections, including letting workers pursue creative work in addition to their work at Sega and a guaranteed continuation of hybrid work. 
Workers will also receive just cause protections, joining Tender Claws workers in being the only ones in the North American video game industry to have them, organizers said. In the state of California, where Sega of Americaâs offices are located, workers are employed at will â meaning employers can terminate employees for almost any reason, provided that reason is not unlawful. These protections mean employers must follow a series of strict guidelines before getting rid of a worker, whether through firing or other means.
Organizers for the union say contact negotiations between AEGIS-CWA and Sega of America spanned six months. 
âOne of our most notable items is our grievance process,â said Em Geiger, a localization editor at Sega of America, in an interview with Polygon. âThereâs extra security knowing we have in place a system for bringing issues to the table, such as arguing just cause in a potential layoff. If the company wants to do something that the unit doesnât like, we can grieve it, bargain over it, have our say before anything is finalized.â
Geiger described the bargaining process with Sega of America (SOA) as challenging, citing long hours, extra labor, and organizing resistance. 
âOne of the most difficult things about all of this was the mass layoff of temporary employees,â Geiger said, referring to cuts at Sega of America announced in January. âThere is no understating the enormous hit we took to our support numbers, to morale, to our working relationships when SOA announced they were going to lay off temps. A contract cannot ensure you arenât laid off. At the end of the day, it was a business decision. But the anger and the grief and the sorrow were natural responses for us. At the very least, we were able to negotiate severance packages for those who were at risk of losing their jobs.â
Earlier this year, Sega of America proposed laying off 61 employees at the company. AEGIS-CWA said that, through collective bargaining, it wound up saving the jobs of 18 of those people and won more favorable severance packages for laid-off employees. 
Workers at the games studio and publisher announced their intent to unionize in April 2023. The union partnered with the Communications Workers of America and voted to officially form a union the following July.
AEGIS-CWA now represents employees across multiple departments at Sega of Americaâs headquarters in Burbank and its Irvine campus. Union employees work in a variety of roles, including brand marketing, localization, marketing services, product development, sales, and quality assurance.

Overwatch 2âs new hero Venture is playable for free this weekend,"The next hero coming to Overwatch 2, Venture, will be playable this weekend for free as part of a limited-time trial that will run from March 28-31, Blizzard Entertainment announced Wednesday. Access to Venture will be free for all players, giving everyone a taste of their kit, which Blizzard also revealed in full.
Venture is a new damage hero who wields a drill-like weapon known as the Smart Excavator. Their primary weapon lets them fire a seismic charge that bursts after traveling a short distance. It also lets Venture burrow underground, where theyâll be invulnerable to attack, then emerge upward to deal damage. Ventureâs Smart Excavator also lets them dash forward, pushing enemies back, with the Drill Dash ability. They also have two passives: Explorerâs Resolve, which grants them temporary shields when using abilities; and Clobber, which deals more damage when using a melee attack.
Ventureâs ultimate ability, Tectonic Shock, sends out damaging shockwaves, as seen in the gameplay trailer above.
Blizzard revealed Venture at BlizzCon 2023 in November as Overwatch 2âs 18th damage-class hero and the gameâs first nonbinary hero. Venture will be released officially on April 16, when season 10 of Overwatch 2 kicks off.
When season 10 launches next month, it will bring an important change to how Blizzard releases new heroes for Overwatch 2. Venture will be available for free to all players at the same time, and wonât be locked behind the gameâs battle pass. Overwatch 2 players will also get free access to all of the gameâs previously released heroes, like Mauga, Illari, and Lifeweaver, when season 10 launches. New players will still need to complete the first-time user experience to unlock heroes.
Blizzard plans to release at least one more hero this year. A new support hero, codenamed Space Ranger, will launch with season 12 of Overwatch 2. ",https://www.polygon.com/24113610/overwatch-2-venture-release-date-free-trial,2024-03-27 16:47:39
Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimosâ next movie is a crime thriller that looks nothing like Poor Things,"Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos are quickly becoming one of Hollywoodâs most exciting duos. The pair has already teamed up on two excellent movies, with Poor Things and The Favourite, and now itâs completing its collaborative trio with Kinds of Kindness. The movieâs first trailer was released on Wednesday, and it already looks like a fascinating change of pace from the duoâs previous work. 
Kinds of Kindnessâ first trailer doesnât clear up much about its plot. Itâs bookended by Emma Stoneâs character peeling out in a purple Challenger, with some pretty vague narration. In between, we get brief glimpses of the rest of the cast, including Jesse Plemons (Game Night), Willem Dafoe (Poor Things), Margaret Qualley (Sanctuary), Hong Chau (Watchmen), Joe Alwyn (The Favourite), Mamoudou Athie (Elemental), and Hunter Schafer (Euphoria). Each of these scenes is short, gorgeous looking, and very cryptic. But itâs hard not to be excited by this bizarre crime thriller/comedy.
The trailerâs YouTube description is slightly more informative about the plot: 
Kinds of Kindness is a triptych fable, following a man without choice who tries to take control of his own life; a policeman who is alarmed that his wife who was missing-at-sea has returned and seems a different person; and a woman determined to find a specific someone with a special ability, who is destined to become a prodigious spiritual leader.
Kinds of Kindness is set for release in theaters on June 21. ",https://www.polygon.com/24113548/kinds-kindness-trailer-emma-stone-yorgos-lanthimos-poor-things-new-movie,2024-03-27 16:20:50
New hero shooter Marvel Rivals looks like Overwatch with Marvel heroes,"A new team-based multiplayer hero shooter starring the superheroes and supervillains of the Marvel Universe is on the way from Marvel and NetEase Games. Itâs called Marvel Rivals, and it will pit two teams of six heroes against each other on battlefields like Asgard and Tokyo 2099 that are built around destruction.
Marvel Rivals is being developed for PC by a team composed of developers who have worked on the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises. The game has Overwatch vibes, being a free-to-play game with an expanding lineup of heroes and villains to play as, but is played from a third-person perspective. Eighteen heroes and villains are confirmed for the roster so far: Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Groot, Hulk, Iron Man, Loki, Luna Snow, Magik, Magneto, Mantis, Namor, Peni Parker, Rocket Raccoon, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, Storm, Star-Lord, and The Punisher. 
At least 12 of those characters will be playable in an upcoming alpha test. And given the massive population of the Marvel Universe, expect that number to grow to include many more fan favorites.
What makes Marvel Rivals potentially more interesting â and decidedly Marvel â than other hero shooters is its Team-Up moves, in which multiple characters can combine their powers for awesome effect. For example, you can pair Guardians of the Galaxy members Groot and Rocket Raccoon to become a rootinâ-shootinâ duo, or Hulk can lend Tony Stark powerful gamma radiation to power up his repulsors. (So far, thereâs no confirmation that thereâll be a Wolverine-Colossus fastball special, or a Hawkeye-Ant-Man arrow ride, but come on, those have to be coming at some point!)
In Marvel Rivalsâ announcement trailer, we see a variety of comic book heroes and villains using their trademark abilities in combat. Doctor Strange creates portals for his team to travel through. Loki transforms into other characters, gaining their superpowers. Spider-Man unleashes a flurry of thwips to ensnare the opposing team as part of his ult. Black Panther summons a giant version of Bast to smash through his foes.
Marvel Rivals will also include a few deeper cuts, including the relatively-new-to-the-Marvel Universe hero Luna Snow, an ice mage/K-pop star who was originally created for another game, Marvel Future Fight. Galacta, the daughter of Galactus, appears to be overseeing the gameâs six-on-six battles, which are narratively tied to a story about converging timelines and a war between Doctor Dooms.
Thaddeus Sasser, game director on Marvel Rivals, has worked on games in the Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Ghost Recon franchises for more than 20 years. He told Polygon in an interview that âbeing able to play as your favorite hero in a multiplayer game is something that was super appealing to me, and I think itâs something that appeals to a lot of players. Think about some of the famous characters from Marvel comics â thereâs a whole list of things you can start to imagine happening in the game. Also, having magical superpowers in a multiplayer game is something that hasnât really been done to death. Itâs still kind of relatively fresh and new, and the way weâre doing it, and some of the tricks weâve got up our sleeves should be pretty exciting for new players.â
Sasser added that heroes and villains in Marvel Rivals will have a range of powers, and that characters wonât be locked into specific class roles. But there will be something to akin to categories, like tank, DPS, and support, to help players figure out what a particular hero will perform. 
âWe call it a shooter, because of the style of play,â Sasser said, noting that the game will feature a mix of ranged, close-quarters, and melee combat styles. âA hero like Hulk, why would you give him a gun?â The gameâs Team-Up moves will range from simpler hero-on-hero pairings, like the Rocket and Groot move, as well as more complex Team-Ups that require more skill, finesse, timing, and additional characters to pull off.
Developers at NetEase are still fine-tuning some of the gameâs rules, particularly around picking characters and what restrictions will apply to teams, Sasser said. Details on game modes are forthcoming, but interested players will get a taste of Marvel Rivals in May, when the gameâs alpha test is expected to launch.",https://www.polygon.com/24112564/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-trailer-release-date-netease,2024-03-27 15:00:00
One of the greatest game soundtracks of all time just hit streaming,"Keita Takahashiâs surreal gaming masterpiece Katamari Damacy marks its 20th anniversary this year, and publisher Bandai Namco has done something truly meaningful to celebrate: Itâs resolved whatever rights issues were keeping the gameâs classic soundtrack album off music streaming services, and republished it. Royal rainbow!
The album, officially titled Katamari Fortissimo Damacy, really is one of the all-time great game soundtracks. (Iâm listening to it as I type â you can find it on Spotify and Apple Music.) Fitting the cheerful, absurdist tone of a game about rolling up miscellaneous junk into ever larger balls until you consume the solar system itself, itâs an eclectic collage of styles in the shibuya-kei tradition: hectic bubblegum drum and bass, samba, lounge jazz, J-pop, hip-hop, electro, chiptunes, and more.
One of the things that makes this soundtrack so unique and memorable is that Bandai Namco didnât assemble its jumble of styles by throwing licensed tracks into the mix. Incredibly, itâs all original and bespoke music for the game; the soundtrack was written and produced by a team led by Yuu Miyake, and lyrical and melodic themes keep recurring across its 21 tracks.
Itâs all great, but if I was forced to pick highlights, Iâd choose: âLonely Rolling Star,â a lovely chiptune pop song with vocals by Saki Kabata; rolling and scatting swing jazz number âRed Rose with Gin & Tonicâ; astral electro freak-out âTaste of an Angelâ; the immaculate bossa nova stylings of âRoll Me Inâ; and the utterly adorable âCherry Blossomsâ, sung by a chorus of little kids over swooning strings and plucked acoustic guitar.
The only thing that could be better for your mood right now than listening to this soundtrack is playing Katamari Damacy. Itâs available now in a remaster called Katamari Damacy Reroll for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. Thereâs also a remaster available of its direct sequel We Love Katamari, which is just as good; hopefully that gameâs soundtrack album is on its way back, too.",https://www.polygon.com/24113438/katamari-damacy-soundtrack-on-spotify-at-last,2024-03-27 14:51:45
"The Spider Within, a new Spider-verse short, finds Miles Morales struggling with great responsibilities","Thereâs still no word as to when we can expect Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, the indefinitely delayed follow-up to 2023âs Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Thereâs still good news for Spidey fans, though: A new short film set in the Spider-Verse starring Miles Morales hit the web on Wednesday. 
Set between the events of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story sees Miles struggling with the combined expectations and responsibilities of being a high school student and an arachnid-themed superhero. Long story short: The pressureâs getting to him, so much so that heâs being haunted by a shadowy doppelganger of himself. Wracked with anxiety, Miles will have to find a way to overcome this new challenge.
Created through Sonyâs LENS (Leading and Empowering New Storytellers) program, the short originally premiered at last yearâs Annecy International Animation Film Festival. Produced in partnership with the Kevin Love Fund, The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story was directed by Jarelle Dampier (Invincible) and written by Khaila Amazan (Curses!).",https://www.polygon.com/24113442/watch-spider-within-spider-verse-story-short-film-miles-morales,2024-03-27 13:57:46

Will we soon see Epic Games Store and others on Xbox consoles?,"Phil Spencer doesnât just want Xbox games on other consoles. He wants other video game retailers on Xbox, too.
In an interview with Microsoftâs CEO of Gaming during the annual Game Developers Conference, Spencer told Polygon about the ways heâd like to break down the walled gardens that have historically limited players to making purchases through the first-party stores tied to each console. Or, in layperson terms, why you should be able to buy games from other stores on Xbox â not just the official storefront. 
Spencer mentioned his frustrations with closed ecosystems, so we asked for clarity. Could he really see a future where stores like Itch.io and Epic Games Store existed on Xbox? Was it just a matter of figuring out mountains of paperwork to get there?
âYes,â said Spencer. â[Consider] our history as the Windows company. Nobody would blink twice if I said, âHey, when youâre using a PC, you get to decide the type of experience you have [by picking where to buy games]. Thereâs real value in that.â Spencer believes console players would benefit from that freedom too â and so would console makers like Microsoft.
Spencer explained how, in the past, console makers would typically subsidize the cost of expensive hardware, knowing that a portion of every dollar spent on games for the platform over the years would eventually make it back to the console maker. Then, in time, the console maker would recoup the subsidy â and hopefully more. 
But, Spencer said, âMooreâs Law has slowed down. The price of the components of a console arenât coming down as fast as they have in previous generations.â Worse, he explained, the console market isnât growing, with more gamers moving to PC and handheld options. Now, the notion of subsidizing a console â and forcing players to purchase games through the official storefront to help recoup costs â might not make sense. The walls meant to lock people into consoles might be motivating them to stay out. 
â[Subsidizing hardware] becomes more challenging in todayâs world,â Spencer said. âAnd I will say, and this may seem too altruistic, I donât know that itâs growing the industry. So I think, what are the barriers? What are the things that create friction in todayâs world for creators and players? And how can we be part of opening up that model?â

The answer, in part, is scrapping exclusivity on more and more Xbox games. Spencer explained that the game experience is hindered when it matters what consoles we play on or what shops sell us our games. As an example, he pointed to Sea of Thieves. A player, he explained, shouldnât have to worry about what hardware they or their friends own. They should just know if their friends have and want to play Sea of Thieves.
Now, Spencer said, âif I want to play on a gaming PC, then I feel like Iâm more a continuous part of a gaming ecosystem as a whole. As opposed to [on console], my gaming is kind of sharded â to use a gaming term â based on these different closed ecosystems that I have to play across.â
Spencerâs view sounds reasonable on paper. The console market is flat. The PC market is growing in part because it gives players a choice in where they buy games. So, if consoles want to bring players back, theyâll need to be more like PCs. And that means bringing down the walled gardens that, for decades, have protected the financial model of game consoles. 
If Spencer wants to make that vision a reality, then itâs reasonable that we could one day boot up our Xboxes and see Epic Games Store, Itch.io, and other shops waiting to sell us games â and hopefully competing with one another to bring players the best possible deals.

Phil Spencer on what the hell is happening in the games industry,"âThe math on [making] a game has definitely changed,â said Phil Spencer, CEO of Gaming at Microsoft.
Polygon spoke with Spencer during the annual Game Developers Conference, and though the conversation ranged from the possibility of a handheld console to the trouble with closed platforms, one theme was inescapable: What the hell is going on with the games industry? And how will video game makers and publishers â Xbox included â get out of it?
Spencerâs views point to a collision of rising budgets, diversifying business models, and the exceptional financial risk now required to meet the audience expectations of a AAA release. He specifically pointed to the astronomical budgets of big-budget games, which have created a knot of problems that has been a challenge to disentangle. And for Spencer, the path forward is to abandon assumptions about exclusivity and attract new customers who have cooled on the console experience.
But first, for context, Spencer talked about how things used to work when budgeting and greenlighting a video game. The Microsoft exec has been producing games for long enough that he can remember when the financials were relatively straightforward. A publisher could set a sales goal (say, 800,000 units), set an earnout goal (how much money they want to make), and set the price of the game (usually $59.99). From there, a video gameâs publisher and/or studio could set a budget.
However, the financial calculus has changed. In 2024, most games are sold across multiple storefronts, often steeply discounted mere weeks after release or included as part of subscription services on launch day. Plus, the games themselves take many years to create with the help of hundreds, if not thousands, of team members, sometimes spread across the world. All of this adds up, and as Spencer says, it can cost â$300 million to build a video game.â
Spencer explained how this cost forces three substantial problems: one for all big-budget games, one unique to console exclusives, and one that spans the entire industry.
These problems have had a very real, substantial, and immediate human cost. The industry has seen consistent and mounting layoffs, including a particularly rough start to this year. Shortly after Microsoftâs acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, the company announced it would be laying off 1,900 workers from its gaming division.
Polygon asked Spencer if the ABK layoffs were part of this wider trend, or if there was something unique about the layoffs as they pertain to the current Xbox business.
âItâs a little bit of both,â said Spencer. âBut Iâll say the thing that has me most concerned for the industry is the lack of growth. And when you have an industry that is projected to be smaller next year in terms of players and dollars, and you get a lot of publicly traded companies that are in the industry that have to show their investors growth â because why else does somebody own a share of someoneâs stock if itâs not going to grow? â the side of the business that then gets scrutinized is the cost side. Because if youâre not going to grow the revenue side, then the cost side becomes challenged.

âWeâre a business. Iâve said over and over. I donât get any luxury of not having to run a profitable growing business inside of Microsoft. And we are that today. But just across the industry â you mentioned it, and in sitting here at GDC, I reflect on friends of mine in the industry that have been displaced and lost their jobs and how just, I donât want this industry to be a place where people canât, with confidence, build a career. So thatâs why I keep pivoting back to: How does this industry get back to growth? But to your question, for us as Xbox or any of the teams that are out there, it is really an outcome of an industry thatâs not growing. It can grow and it will grow again. But you see this time right now and the implications have human impact. And we should all reflect on that and think about it.â
As we talked through Microsoftâs plans for growth â both with the company and the wider games space â Spencer continually returned to the idea of exclusivity. This year, Xbox has ported four exclusives to other consoles, like Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5. For Spencer, this is a way to bring more players (and sales) to old games, but itâs also a way to break some old industry habits, like exclusivity, that may be responsible for the stagnation of the console market.
â[Consider] two years of lack of growth in the gaming industry at the top line. You start to ask yourself, Well, I donât want to grow at the expense of the industry, I want to grow as part of the industry, and what do we need to do as an industry to get back on the growth path?
âI will say, every decision we make today and tomorrow is for the better of Xbox,â said Spencer. âI know sometimes things get weaponized, that thereâs some evil in the background thatâs making us do things â âPhil hates exclusives and thatâs why weâre like PlayStation and Switch now.â Every decision we make is to make Xbox stronger in the long run. It doesnât mean everyoneâs going to agree with every decision we make. But it is fundamental for how we make decisions.â
For Spencer, moving toward the future is about walking â in some part â away from exclusivity. 
âThis notion that Xbox can only be this one device that plugs into a television isnât something we see in the Gen Z research. Because nothing else is like that for them. Some of them will have an iPhone, some will have an Android, but all the games and everything is the same. I can still get to TikTok on both of them, at least for now. All of their stuff is available wherever they want. So for Xbox, our brand pivot â as we attract and maintain relevance with a younger audience â is âXbox is a place where I can find the great games I want to.ââ",https://www.polygon.com/24108700/phil-spencer-interview-2024-xbox-exclusives-layoffs,2024-03-26 12:00:00

Final Fantasy 14âs new expansion is staying the hell out of Elden Ring DLCâs way,"Final Fantasy 14 Onlineâs next expansion, the summer-vacation adventure Dawntrail, will officially launch on July 2, producer and director Naoki Yoshida announced Sunday. Early access to Dawntrail will go live on June 28, for players who have pre-ordered the expansion.
Yoshida announced Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrailâs release date at PAX East during a panel that revisited the history of the online role-playing game and the journey to its new expansion. He noted that Square Enix wanted to start early access to Dawntrail a week earlier, but âwe figured that everyone would be interested in playing the Elden Ring DLC,â Shadow of the Erdtree, which launches on June 21. Yoshidaâs announcement was met with laughter from the audience who were no doubt well aware of the highly anticipated releases of both add-ons. 
âIâll give you one week!â Yoshida said, laughing, âEnjoy Elden Ring DLC, then just go into your summer vacation in Dawntrail.â He added, âI just want to make it clear, itâs not because I want to play Elden Ring DLC and then play Dawntrail, although I am looking forward to it.â
Elden Ringâs original release in 2022 coincided with the launch of another massive open-world game, Horizon Forbidden West. Guerrilla Gameâs sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn was released one week before Elden Ring, and FromSoftwareâs game wound up dominating the discourse at the time, leading to a more muted response to Forbidden West. (The Horizon sequel has sold about a third of that of its predecessor, Sony says.) Square Enix is seemingly hoping to avoid a similar fate with Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail this summer.
Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail will give players of the MMO a brand-new story, two new playable jobs (Pictomancer and Viper), new dungeons and encounters, and an increased level cap to 100. For more, you can catch up on Yoshidaâs Final Fantasy 14 panel from PAX East 2024 in the video below.",https://www.polygon.com/24111664/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-release-date-elden-ring-dlc,2024-03-25 19:05:08
Dragonâs Dogma 2âs pawn plague is wreaking havoc in the game,"Dragonâs Dogma 2 players will no doubt have heard whispers from their faithful followers, known as pawns, about a terrible plague infecting their ranks. Unfortunately, that sickness is real and currently spreading through Capcomâs fantasy role-playing game via its pawns, and itâs led to the mass murders of NPCs like merchants and quest-givers.
The cataclysmic results of the plague are causing some players to worry that itâs âruiningâ their game saves â and Dragonâs Dogma 2 currently only lets players have one of those (although a change is coming). But the ultimate impact of that spreading infection may not be as bad as it seems.
The infection known as Dragonsplague is foreshadowed by playersâ overly chatty pawns over the course of Dragonâs Dogma 2âs story. Dragonsplague, pawns warn, will make the infected violent, aggressive, and dismissive of their masterâs orders. It can be contracted by hiring a pawn who is already infected, or though combat interactions with drakes and dragons, where it can spread between party members.
Left unaddressed, a pawn with full-blown Dragonsplague will transform into a shadowy dragon themselves and lay waste to entire towns full of people. Hereâs an instance of Dragonsplague resulting in the deaths of scores of residents in Vernworth. Yes, everyone but the playerâs main pawn and a few soldiers are left dead.
The game adds insult to injury by chiding the player, âIf only you had been more observant, perhaps this tragedy could have been prevented.â
Thankfully, preventing the spread isnât difficult. Players will get an in-game warning at the first threat of an infection, but the symptoms of an Dragonsplagued pawn arenât so easy to spot â  you have to pay attention. Plagued pawns will show signs of sickness, like coughing and visible discomfort; theyâll touch their head as if checking for fever or a headache. Theyâll also start to disobey commands, responding with phrases like âI will act of my own accordâ or âDonât tell me what to do!â More subtly, their eyes will start to pulse with a reddish hue.
There are a few ways to address a Dragonsplague infection. If one of your hired pawns is infected, quickly dismiss it â or intentionally kill it by throwing it off a cliff or into a river â before the plague affects other members of your party. If your main pawn is infected, your best recourse is to kill them. Throw them into the Brine to drown them, then bring them back using a Riftstone.
The most important thing to avoid is resting at an inn. Doing so will initiate the full-on murder spree seen in the video above.
Stressing out over a Dragonsplague infection may not be worth the fuss, however. And you shouldnât use all your Wakestones (and certainly donât buy any!) to revive dead NPCs right away. While a plague outbreak that results in mass murder may seem like a game-ruining problem, players are reporting that a wiped-out town will eventually repopulate, and that some NPCs may come back to life over time. (Other characters in the world have to have Wakestones too, right?)
On the Dragonâs Dogma 2 subreddit, a player reported that one of their towns was decimated by the plague, they simply fast forwarded a week by resting at a bench. âEveryone (side and main quests NPCs) respawned. Finished the game as normal. DID NOT need any Wakestones,â they report.
With Dragonsplague quickly spreading through the huge player base of Dragonâs Dogma 2, weâre likely to learn even more about how the infection spreads and how players can best deal with it in the coming days.
For now, keep your eyes peeled for any disobedient pawns with signs of infection.",https://www.polygon.com/24111539/dragons-dogma-2-dragon-plague-npcs-pawns,2024-03-25 18:15:00
"Cozy life sim Palia arrives on Steam, celebrates with big friendly frog","Palia first launched on PC in 2023, and rolled out onto the Nintendo Switch. Now, the free-to-play life simulator game can be downloaded from Steam. The new platform for Palia coincides with patch 0.178, which is focused around celebrating spring. If you havenât had a chance to sample this Stardew Valley-style game, nowâs a great time to start foraging, farming, and building your own cozy little house in Kilima Valley.
In Palia, the player awakens from a long stasis in a world that had nearly forgotten humanity. Now that humans are back, they have to re-integrate with the elves and golems of Kilima Valley and Bahari Bay. Luckily, itâs a peaceful place, with lots of room to explore, garden, cook, and catch fish and/or bugs.
Patch 0.178 introduces a new elemental temple. After going through water, fire, and air themed temples in previous updates, players are now going to delve into the Temple of the Roots with the eccentric golem Einar. Each temple comes with a series of quests that, when completed, open up bundles of collective goods to fulfill. Those who can find all of the bundled items earn handsome rewards, like a new cosmetic for their home, or a new fish entering the ecosystem.
Appropriately for spring, the new patch also includes new flowers. Catching bugs in Kilima Valley has the chance to drop flower seeds, which can then be planted around your plot. Home decorating and building is one of the biggest parts of Paliaâs appeal, so itâs nice to see new ways to spruce up your home.
Developer and publisher Singularity 6 has also shared a roadmap for development, which includes new building blocks and structures, a new level of friendship to earn with villagers, pathways and walkways for your plot, and a map grid for easier coordination.
As for the giant frog, affectionately dubbed Frogbert, heâs just hanging out in Kilima Valley as a reward from Singularity 6 for all of those who added Palia to their Steam wishlist. We can only hope this big froggy boy has good intentions, because if he chooses, he could crush us all underfoot. I, for one, welcome our new Frogbert overlord.

A handheld Xbox? Microsoftâs gaming chief canât stop thinking about it,"Phil Spencer has tried all of the new PC gaming handhelds: the Asus ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, and the Steam Deck. Heâs impressed. But he canât shake one question. How would he make them more Xbox?
âI want my Lenovo Legion Go to feel like an Xbox,â Spencer told Polygon in an interview during the annual Game Developers Conference. âI brought [the Legion Go] with me to GDC. Iâm on the airplane and I have this list of everything that makes it not feel like an Xbox. Forget about the brand. More like: Are all of my games there? Do all my games show up with the save [files] that I want? Iâll tell you one [game] that doesnât right now â itâs driving me crazy â is Fallout 76. It doesnât have cross-save.
âI want to be able to boot into the Xbox app in a full screen, but in a compact mode. And all of my social [experience] is there. Like I want it to feel like the dash of my Xbox when I turn on the television. [Except I want it] on those devices.â
According to Spencer, the Xbox hardware team, led by Roanne Sones, is considering âdifferent hardware form factors and things that [they] could go doâ as it plans the future of Xbox hardware. âWhat should we build that will find new players?â Spencer said. âThat will allow people to play at times when they couldnât go play [in the past]?â
In our expansive interview, Spencer described two approaches to making Xbox available on handhelds: the hardware versus the software approach. As he said, he has strong feelings about what a handheld Xbox device should feel like. But he also recognizes â having learned from the console business â that players may choose brands other than Xbox. For those players, Spencer wants to improve the Xbox handheld gaming software experience, too â particularly for people who have devices running Windows, like the Legion Go and the Ally.
âI like the fact that Valve, Lenovo, and Asus went out and innovated in a new form factor. And I will say that when Iâm playing on those devices, it almost feels more like a console than a PC â nine times out of 10. The things that usually frustrate me are more Windows-based than device-based. Which is an area I feel some ownership of. Like, I want to be able to log in with a controller. Iâve got my list of things we should go do.â
Spencer has spent his tenure at Microsoft pushing Xbox to be both a console experience and a software experience that follows players wherever they enjoy games. That philosophy expands with his views on handheld gaming.
âFrom a game creator standpoint,â Spencer said, âI can then go build a single version of my game that spans more hardware and reaches more customers. And I would say for players, it reduces the friction. Like, if I want to go play my console games on the go with a handheld, I donât want to only be able to buy one brand of handheld. Right? [â¦] I want everything that weâre doing in the hardware space to be great. But if somebody chooses to go play today [somewhere else], I donât want them to feel like a lesser Xbox [player].â
Over the past seven years, weâve seen the Xbox development team get creative with its software, moving games to new platforms, building up the Game Pass subscription service, and making games playable on smartphones through streaming. As we wrapped our conversation, Spencer wouldnât outright announce an official Xbox handheld, but he did say he sees a similar level of creativity coming to hardware that Xbox has brought to software.
âI think itâs important,â said Spencer. âYou and I, weâve been around for a couple of days. Look at the real inflection points in our industry, like look at the Wii. It was hardware innovation that was linked with great software innovation.â",https://www.polygon.com/24108660/xbox-handheld-console-phil-spencer-interview,2024-03-25 13:00:00
There were an obscene amount of trailers this week,"Summer blockbuster is near, and if you need proof look no further than the avalanche of trailers that came out this week.

Donât let the propaganda fool you: Helldivers 2 definitely added flying bugs,"Just as Helldivers 2 tweaked the spawn rates for the gameâs super-armored Terminids, developer Arrowhead Game Studios has added a new threat: flying bugs. Arrowhead did not mention the Terminids with wings in its March 13 patch notes, but players on social media and forums reported spotting the creatures in-game. The new Terminids are called Shriekers, and are quite terrifying as they dive and attack.
Arrowhead warned in the patch notes that the changed Chargers and Bile Titans werenât lowering difficulty. But players were unprepared for exactly what we were in for.
Keeping in line with Helldivers 2 lore, Arrowhead is denying the existence of the bugs: âEveryone knows that âBugs canât fly,ââ CEO Johan Pilestedt posted to X, formerly Twitter. âAnd Iâm not alone in thinking this. The Ministry of Truth agrees that this is propaganda from bug sympathizers that want to brainwash good people.  #Liesâ
However, on Friday, Pilestedt changed his tune on X, writing that he always knew there was a âpossibilityâ that the flying bugs existed â and also that everybody knows bugs can fly. He also added, in Helldivers 2 fashion, that it may or may not have to do with a recent major order that tasked players with testing and activating Termicide Towers, which would theoretically wipe the bugs out.
âTo those unpatriotic citizens that question the timing of TCS and Termicide testing and deployment - this is completely coincidental and unrelated,â he wrote. â9/9 Reputable and Super Earth sanctioned scientists agree.â
This update â or propaganda, depending on who you ask â is part of Helldivers 2âs evolving story. Though the game doesnât have a campaign, the storytelling is everywhere: Starting from the intro and tutorial, Helldivers 2 sets up a world of propaganda and unabashed patriotism. The government is not fascist! Itâs pushing for freedom! As Polygonâs Cass Marshal put it, âWe know exactly what kind of war this is, and how each individual Helldiver is doomed to get dissolved by bile or exploded by a robot,â they wrote. âBut they donât know that, and by the time the revelation wears off, the entire thing becomes a wonderfully dark comedy.â
Flying bugs and the denial of it all is just another piece of the Helldivers 2 story. You may remember a similar situation with the addition of mechs. And now that flying Terminids have been confirmed, we expect the game to continue and surprise us.
Update (March 22): Added an update from Pilestedt where he confirmed that flying Terminids indeed exist in-game and that it was likely due to the Termicide testing from a previous major order.",https://www.polygon.com/24099472/helldivers-2-flying-bugs-terminids-update-patch,2024-03-22 20:01:56
"Much like Disney Lorcana, the Star Wars: Unlimited TCG is in short supply","Fantasy Flight Games was founded in 1995 on the shoulders of a single board game called Twilight Imperium, an epic space opera starring space cats and peace turtles. But as of this week, the Minnesota-based companyâs biggest success is thanks to slightly more conventional space opera â fan favorite Star Wars. 
The Star Wars: Unlimited trading card game, barely a week old at this point, is a smash hit. In a statement on social media, the publisher said it had âalready far exceeded the sales of any game we have ever released.â But like its competitor, Disney Lorcana, that means cards are in short supply. That has emboldened speculators, who are driving prices up on the secondary market, but not nearly to the extent that Ravensburgerâs game suffered.
Wednesday on social media, the publisher announced its plans to mitigate the issue nonetheless. According to Fantasy Flightâs statement, it was always assumed that launch product would run out, just not this soon. So the strategy that they had formed for this inevitability is being put into motion a few weeks early.
âAlthough we still have stock available,â Fantasy Flight said on X, âthe strategy we are discussing with our distribution partners is to release the available product in measured waves until Set 2 is released.â The company said the intent is to keep a âsteady flowâ of new cards trickling out to the most dedicated players, that is those showing up for organized events at local stores â you know, the people actually opening up and playing with the cards rather than hoarding or flipping them. Retailers were asked to keep in touch with their distribution partners for more information.
Itâs unclear just how big a portion of that first print run is still in Fantasy Flightâs warehouse, but the writing is on the wall. Fans should expect prices to remain high until at least July, when the second set of cards, titled Shadows of the Galaxy, is expected to show up at retail.
Fantasy Flightâs competitor, Ravensburger, played things a bit differently during the launch of Disney Lorcana last year. The German company announced a second printing of its launch set, and pulled stock back from its planned European release to satisfy Americaâs demand for the game. That had the effect of lowering the cost of sealed product on the secondary market. Since Fantasy Flightâs announcement mid-week, however, prices have just kept going up.
Correction: The original version of this article misstated the price of booster boxes on the secondary market. Weâve adjusted the article to reflect that.",https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24108645/star-wars-unlimited-tcg-sold-out-price-scalpers,2024-03-22 18:46:13
"Dragonâs Dogma 2âs surprise microtransactions are making people angry, but should they?","Capcomâs fantasy role-playing game Dragonâs Dogma 2 has launched at last to critical acclaim â but reactions from some players are much harsher. At the center of these complaints is a suite of 21 downloadable items Capcom released without warning alongside Dragonâs Dogma 2 across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. Most of them are single-use in-game items enabling features like new fast-travel locations, the ability to change charactersâ appearance, and combat revives.
On Steam, where Dragonâs Dogma 2 was a much-hyped and wishlisted title, user reviews sit at âMostly Negativeâ at time of writing. Alongside the microtransactions, critical players cite the gameâs poor performance on PC, and the developerâs use of the unpopular anti-cheat and anti-piracy software Denuvo. (Polygon has contacted Capcom for comment and will update if we hear back.)
Capcom is often criticized for tagging a lot of microtransactions onto largely single-player games, like the Resident Evil 4 remake or Monster Hunter Rise. If Dragonâs Dogma 2 is drawing more ire than usual, it could be because of the way the items on sale interact with Dragonâs Dogma 2âs intentionally challenging and restrictive game design.
Itâs important to note that all the items for sale can be obtained during normal gameplay, so in theory, Capcom is only offering an additional convenience to players. If you play the game for long enough, youâll end up with most of these items in your inventory, such as the Rift Crystals that allow you to hire pawn party members at a higher level than your character to help out with tough fights (500 Rift Crystals cost $0.99, while a pack of 2,500 costs $4.99).
But many of the items for sale are rare, expensive, or difficult to obtain in the game. Wakestones, for example, allow you to revive your character in the middle of combat, and are rare enough that players are advised to save them for use during only the most challenging encounters. But now the temptation is there to just buy your way out of trouble for $0.99.
The Art of Metamorphosis item, which allows you to change your characterâs appearance, can be bought from a vendor, but comes at a high price: 500 Rift Crystals. Thatâs too much to afford early in the game, and sellers have limited inventory. Capcom is selling these for $1.99.
The availability of Portcrystals for $2.99 each has caused some players to accuse Capcom of selling fast travel, but this isnât strictly accurate. Fast travel is very restricted in Dragonâs Dogma 2 by design, to encourage exploration of the open world and to make distances feel significant (a choice that can be frustrating to some players). Portcrystals allow players to create new fast-travel points within the game, which is useful because only a handful exist in major towns. But to use Portcrystals you need Ferrystones, another rare resource. 
Tellingly, Capcom has chosen not to make Ferrystones available as microtransactions, indicating that literally selling fast travel was a design Rubicon the development team was unwilling to cross. Nonetheless, selling Portcrystals is still a controversial choice, given how extremely rare this item is in the game â in our first 50 hours with the game, we only found one, and it was as a quest reward.
Dragonâs Dogma 2 is a single-player game, so itâs easy for players to simply ignore these microtransactions if they find them distasteful. If thereâs an issue, itâs how they interact with the gameâs distinctive design ethos, which is to use the scarcity of these items (among other things) to make the experience more challenging and immersive. Selling the items would seem to either break that ethos, or call it into question by suggesting scarcity was a sales tactic all along.
Plus, thereâs a $15 bundle on sale that includes 1,500 Rift Crystals and one each of all the DLC items (notably excluding the Portcrystal). This bundle is also included in the gameâs $80 Deluxe Edition, so there is an option for people willing to part with a bit more money.
Capcom briefly commented on the situation in a post on Steam Friday, noting that players could get the items âin-game or as paid DLC items,â and that it was working on fixes for major PC issues. If it were to go into more detail, it might offer a similar argument to Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada, who recently argued that this kind of monetization was a necessary countermeasure for the rapidly rising cost of game development.
Regardless of the reasoning behind them, Dragonâs Dogma 2âs microtransactions are unlikely to tarnish its reputation for good; itâs an engrossing game that seems likely to captivate even more players than its cultish predecessor. But theyâre another sign of the increasing pressure on AAA game development â and thatâs probably here to stay. 
Update: Weâve updated this story to mention a post from Capcom on Steam about PC performance and microtransactions.",https://www.polygon.com/24108587/dragons-dogma-2-microtransactions-dlc-steam-reviews,2024-03-22 18:44:01
"Halo miniatures game wonât require rulers of any kind, making things much easier for newcomers","Since its reveal in early January, Halo fans have been eager for more information on Halo: Flashpoint, a new miniatures game from Mantic Games. On Friday, during the annual AdeptiCon wargaming convention in Schaumburg, Illinois, the British team delivered the goods. Not only do we know what the final products will look like, both painted and unpainted, but we also know quite a lot about how it all will play.
Halo: Flashpoint is a skirmish game, a miniatures wargaming genre thatâs incredibly hot right now. Just like titles such as Star Wars: Shatterpoint, Cyberpunk: Combat Zone, and Warhammer 40:000: Kill Team, Flashpoint will only require a handful of miniatures to play. But unlike those other games, it wonât require a ruler. Thatâs because it uses the novel cube-based system at the core of another Mantic title: a skirmish game called Deadzone.
In Deadzone, which has free quickstart rules on Manticâs website, cubes are used to measure out both movement and shooting. Meanwhile, cover is determined by true line-of-sight â meaning that all you need to do is get down to eye level with your miniature to properly see what it sees.
âThe [24-inch-square] arena board is divided into an eight-by-eight grid,â explained Dan Mapleston, Manticâs strategic marketing manager, in an email. âBut as the game is played on more than just floor level, we refer to each space as a cube (rather than a square) to also allow for moving up and down between levels, or sniping at enemies below you.â
All units are given a movement range measured in cubes, and players just count the cubes they need to move through to get to where they want to go. Once inside the final cube, players can tweak the precise location of their mini however they like. Maybe you want to tuck it behind a smaller piece of cover or poke its head out to maintain visual contact with the enemy. In that way, it works a lot like a modern real-time strategy video game, where the player directs a unitâs movement while individual AI-controlled soldiers within that unit adjust themselves into a final position.

âItâs a system thatâs super intuitive once people understand it,â Mapleston said. It should also scale well with even the most elaborate terrain, which could help Flashpoint feel just as fast and fluid as the classic video gameâs multiplayer modes.
Combat also sounds particularly lethal. The d8-based system uses an exploding dice mechanic, meaning that rolling an eight adds additional dice â and additional damage â to the roll. Mantic has thus dubbed it the âHeadshotsâ mechanic.
Two editions of the game go up for pre-order today. The Recon Edition ($75) includes eight pre-assembled miniatures in red and blue plastic plus a smattering of terrain. The Spartan Edition ($125), meanwhile, offers 16 Spartans, four Banished Elite models in gray, and various âcomponent upgrades.â The Deluxe Terrain Set ($100) appears to include at least some components seen in previous Deadzone releases. Thereâs also a small set of Army Painterâs newfangled Fanatic Paints along with a special Master Chief miniature ($50). The game launches formally this fall.
Update: Prior to publication, pricing for Halo: Flashpoint and its accessories was not known. Weâve updated the article based on the launch of Manticâs pre-order website.

House of the Dragon is forcing you to pick a side with its season 2 trailers,"House of the Dragon promised all-out war between its two Targaryen factions, and so far, promo for season 2 is delivering â literally â with trailers for the dueling branches of the family going head to head. 
Both start with a rallying cry for their one true ruler and their steadfast belief in their legitimate claim to the throne: Rhaenyra (Emma DâArcy) on the Black side and Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) on the Green side. But the narratives divest from there. 
Although both trailers show the opposing house, HBO was clever to vary the glimpses of the Targaryens going about their business. It may all be the typical quick cuts and furrowed brows of any traditional teaser, but weâre technically getting more of a look into where these unhappy people find themselves (even if itâs hard to tell what notable book events might get featured; we still donât even know for sure who Daemon was singing to at the end of season 1). 
But hereâs what we know: Rhaenyra and Alicent (Olivia Cooke) each still feel personally wounded by the other. Corlys (Steve Toussaint) warns that the Hightowers are marching, while Otto (Rhys Ifans) maintains his grandsonâs right to be king. Daemon (Matt Smith) threatens to burn a house down for not bending the knee to Rhaenyra, while Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) looks forward to fighting his uncle because heâs a little freak who lives for the drama. One thing that becomes clear watching these trailers: Gone are the time jumps of season 1. We will be feeling the agony of this Dance of Dragons in real-time (or near it; itâs still TV).
As of the time of this writing, Team Black is in the lead in this Targaryen Civil War, with more than 100,000 more views on YouTube. That doesnât mean a ton to a Westerosian highborn, but it means that come June, there might be more people rooting for Rhaenyra and her dragon than Aegon and his. 
House of the Dragon season 2 will premiere on HBO (and Max) on June 16.

Larian Studios wonât make any more Baldurâs Gate games,"Now that Baldurâs Gate 3 has been a huge success both critically and financially, people are looking forward to whatâs next for developer Larian Studios. However, according to studio founder Swen Vincke, the future doesnât lie with the Baldurâs Gate franchise or Dungeons & Dragons as a whole. 
During a talk at the Game Developers Conference on Thursday (spotted by IGN and confirmed by Polygon in a video on the official conference TikTok), Vincke said that Larian wonât be working on any DLC, expansions, or a sequel for the game. It would be handing the IP back to Wizards of the Coast and moving on to unrelated projects. 
âBaldurâs Gate 3 will always have a heart â a warm spot in our hearts. Weâll forever be proud of it, but weâre not going to continue it. Weâre not going to make new expansions, which everybody is expecting us to do. Weâre not going to make Baldurâs Gate 4, which everybody is expecting us to do. Weâre going to move on, weâre going to move away from D&D, and weâre going to start making a new thing,â he said. 
breaking news out of GDC2024: @larianstudios Swen Vincke announces no new expansions for baldursgate3, and no baldursgate4. He said they will be moving on to a new project. Watch his statement here.
Michael Douse, director of publishing at Larian, confirmed the news in a post on X (formerly Twitter). âHad a lot of time to reflect on this incredible adventure as everyone has, and I canât explain how excited I am for the next. Hope you join us for that!â he wrote.
Vincke spoke more about the decision with Gamespot. He explained that he initially wanted to make more Baldurâs Gate, but decided against it.
âThatâs not what we were made for,â Vincke said. âThatâs literally the opposite of what Larian is about. We want to do big, new things. We donât want to rehash the thing that weâve done already.â
All of this doesnât mean Larian wonât continue to work on Baldurâs Gate 3. Just last month, Douse announced that the team would be working on a âcross-platform plan for mod support,â with implementation still many months away.
Hasbro, which owns Wizards of the Coast, recognized how successful Baldurâs Gate 3 was in its 2023 financial report released last month. It stated that much of Wizard of the Coast and digital gamingâs growth can be attributed to Monopoly Go!, Magic: The Gathering, and Baldurâs Gate 3. Itâs also been a huge success critically, winning multiple awards. Just a day before the announcement, Baldurâs Gate 3 won four trophies at the Game Developers Choice Awards (also put on by GDC), including game of the year. It also won game of the year at The Game Awards in 2023. 
Hasbro is therefore interested in growing its gaming output and leaning on the Baldurâs Gate franchise,  as company CEO Chris Cocks mentioned in an earnings call to coincide with the report. 
â2024 is about returning consumer products to profitability, investing for long-term momentum in games, and driving significant improvements in Hasbroâs bottom line [...] In short, weâre putting all the right pieces together to keep investing in our growth initiatives while expanding the ways our franchises reach fans through digital games,â Cocks said. âWe expect a long tail into 2024 and beyond for this mega hit.
However, Wizards of the Coast was hit with layoffs right before Christmas 2023, massively impacting the D&D and Magic teams. This includes the team that helped with Baldurâs Gate 3, according to Vincke.

The new Rock Band 4 guitar has enormous potential for challenge runners,"The new PDP Riffmaster looks like an average guitar controller at a passing glance. In many ways, the $129.99 controller coming out in April is exactly what you expect. But aside from its familiar strum bar, whammy bar, and clusters of colored frets, it has a hardware feature that could make it sought after by a crowd that has no interest in playing music games. 
PDP snuck a Joy-Con-like analog stick near the top of the controllerâs neck, right next to where your thumb naturally rests as you hold the guitar. While its advertised purpose is mostly for mundane stuff, like navigating menus in Rock Band 4, it opens up a box of possibilities for speedrunners and challenge runners who enjoy using guitar controllers for non-music games. 
For over a decade, many have used guitar controllers to play (and sometimes, unbelievably, finish) games, notably ones that are difficult even with standard controllers, like Dark Souls. The finesse that some exude during play is remarkable, considering theyâre moving the character without an analog stick while also controlling the camera lock-on function, attacking, and doing a range of other commands with a very unintuitive button layout. Benjamin âBearzlyâ Gwinâs control scheme for beating Dark Souls back in 2014 with a guitar controller is something to behold. 
Noted non-traditional controller aficionado, modder, and engineer Louis Hamilton (AKA SuperLouis64 on YouTube) told Polygon that where he expects the Riffmaster to shine is by aiding the player with camera lock-on and general movement. Looking back at his time with previous guitar controllers, he said âWhenever the lock-on system would untarget a boss mid-fight, I pretty much would tell my chat âGGâ as I scrambled to press the camera reset/lock-on button on my guitar in hopes I can see the boss again.â
Hamilton is also excited about how the Riffmasterâs analog stick could make it possible to challenge-run âother genres that practically require two joysticks,â like first- and third-person shooters. He previously finished Halo 3 on Legendary difficulty using a different guitar controller, but with a custom control scheme thatâs so punishing I wouldnât wish this challenge on my enemies. He used the orange fret to shift between button assignments, with most buttons having dual purposes. âI pretty much had to line up my shots with the guitar, then move, so it felt like I was playing a pseudo turn-based game while my enemies were not,â Hamilton told me. While he doesnât expect the Riffmaster to make non-music games easier to play on a technical level, he hopes that there will be less work required to adapt its controls.
To address Hamiltonâs hope, the Riffmaster is seemingly easier to adapt. Upon plugging it into my PC and enabling Steam Input for all supported controllers, it âworkedâ without any tweaks on my part in Capcomâs remake of Resident Evil 4. Anyone attempting a challenge run of the game would likely want to refine the controls to their preferences with control-mapping software (the analog stick didnât move Leon as it does natively on a traditional controller), but it was an encouraging sign that getting use out of the Riffmasterâs analog stick isnât limited to the games it was designed for.
Itâs hard to say if the Riffmaster will lead to a reemergence of guitar controller-based speedruns and challenge runs. But its existence alone is a good thing. At $129.99, it isnât cheap, but itâs far less expensive than most of the second-hand guitar controllers listed on Amazon and eBay. Perhaps the lower price will attract more players to join the community. If nothing else, Iâd love to see some of the old guard put the Riffmaster through its paces on Twitch.

The first new guitar controller in years is available to pre-order for $129.99,"If you want to play Rock Band 4 on consoles, it hasnât been easy or affordable to pick up a new guitar controller. Itâs common to find second-hand (ew) guitar controllers selling for $500 or so. Thatâs changing, thankfully, with the launch of PDPâs Riffmaster. Itâs a $129.99 wireless guitar controller thatâs coming to shelves in April for both PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Both ship with a USB-A wireless transceiver, but only the Xbox version promises full Windows compatibility (even so, the PlayStation guitar was still recognized by my desktop). Its design accommodates right- and left-handed players.

                Prices taken at time of publishing.
              
The Riffmaster is also available pre-order at Best Buy (PS, Xbox).
The Riffmaster supports Rock Band 4 out of the box. However, this guitarâs main reason for existence is its planned compatibility with Fortnite Festival, a free-to-play game mode that essentially infuses the Rock Band experience into Fortnite on consoles and PC. Currently, gamers can play the mode with a controller or keyboard â not an ideal setup in either scenario. The exact launch date of the Riffmaster hasnât been shared, but I suspect itâll arrive whenever the instrument integration is ready to go in Fortnite Festival.
Digging into what makes the Riffmaster guitar different from past controllers, to start, itâs rechargeable via USB-C. PDP claims it can last up to 36 hours per charge, and the guitar has a 2-year warranty that covers manufacturing defects. It features a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you can listen to game audio routed through the guitar on a set of headphones. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the Riffmaster features an analog stick where you naturally rest a thumb as you press on guitar frets. It makes menu navigation on consoles much easier than reaching for the D-pad. As far as any other functionality, PDP declined to share more.

The PDP Riffmasterâs pickguard can be lifted up for convenient storage of its USB wireless dongle. And, as you may have expected, there will be additional pickguards available in case you want to customize your guitar. In fact, PDP is offering the pickguard shown above as a freebie to the first 500 people who pre-order the Riffmaster through its site. Otherwise, the guitar ships with a glossy black pickguard that looks totally fine.
I appreciate the features that have been added to modernize the Riffmaster compared to past guitar controllers. Its additions make up for what little it lacks. However, I wish that it had the audio and video sensors present on past Rock Band 4 guitars, which aided in the calibration process by letting the guitar interface directly with your audio and video equipment. Without those sensors present in the Riffmaster, Iâve disappointingly spent more time in the calibration menu in Rock Band 4 than I have actually playing songs.",https://www.polygon.com/deals/24106046/riffmaster-guitar-controller-pre-order-buy-fortnite-festival-rock-band-4,2024-03-21 15:42:04
All the Halo TV show season 3 news weâve heard so far,"Haloâs second season has come to an end, but the Master Chiefâs journey is only just beginning. After all, heâs only just set foot on the ringworld the series is named after. But after a tumultuous season of fighting the USNC, itâs hard to say if more Halo is really on the horizon or not. 
Hereâs everything we know about the future of Paramount Plusâ Halo TV show, and whatâs been said about a potential third season.
[Ed. note: This story contains spoilers for Halo season 2.]
We donât know anything officially, but it sure seems likely now that Master Chief has finally actually arrived on a Halo. On top of that, the creative team behind the series seems optimistic that it will continue, and have been very clear that if they get the green light they have plenty of story left to tell. 
In an interview with Collider, executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said the team wrote the series with the âlong-term view in mind,â and that thereâs already been planning for the story beyond season 2. Meanwhile, season 2âs new showrunner David Wiener told Collider that he approached season 2 trying to leave quite a few door open for the future as well. 
âI hope we get the chance to make more,â Wiener said. âThatâs totally the intention.â
Given that we knew Halo season 2 was coming very early on and it still took almost two years, itâs probably going to be a little while before we get a possible season 3. That being said, season 2 took on a whole new showrunner, so if Wiener sticks around for another season itâs possible it could get made a little quicker. Even still, itâs likely a potential season 3 wouldnât be ready to hit Paramount Plus until sometime around 2026.
Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief seems like a given, along with Jen Taylor as Cortana. The show also seems pretty resolute in sticking with Makeeâs story line, so Charlie Murphy is likely to return as well. As for the rest of the cast, the series seems to be pretty focused on the action happening on Halo â finally â so itâs hard to say who else might join in. And with a few members of the rest of the staff surviving as well, like Bokeem Woodbineâs Soren and Yerin Haâs Kwan, weâre still likely to have a few non-Chief stories to pay attention to as well.
The ending of Halo season 2 suggests season 3 would finally be about Halo, which would be pretty exciting. The show has basically set up a slightly altered version of the first gameâs premise, including the Flood, so itâs we could expect something similar to the story in Combat Evolved, where Master Chief explores the ring, learns its true purpose, and then has to escape.
Telling people to read Halo novels is a little bit like telling them to read into the later books of the Dune series, and Iâm already on the record for that one, so you can bet I have Halo recommendations too. Greg Bearâs Forerunner saga is a trilogy of books set about 100,000 years before the humans and the Covenant meet, and itâs some of the best and weirdest lore Halo has. We get to learn all about the Forerunners and the Flood, as well as bits and pieces of the history of ancient humanity, a spacefaring civilization that nearly wiped out the Forerunners long before Master Chief was even born.",https://www.polygon.com/24106882/halo-season-3-tv-show-release-cast-news,2024-03-21 14:55:25
Margot Robbieâs producing a Sims movie by the director of Loki,"Thereâs going to be a movie based The Sims, according to The Hollywood Reporter â and based on the people involved in producing and directing it, itâs worth taking pretty seriously.
The director is Kate Herron, who directed the entirety of the first season of Loki, which is arguably the high point of the Marvel Cinematic Universeâs adventures in television: smart, slippery, and fun, with a strong visual identity. Herron will co-write the Sims movie with Briony Redman; the pair are frequent collaborators who also wrote an episode of the forthcoming new season of Doctor Who.
The production company behind the Sims movie is even more significant. LuckyChap, which Margot Robbie runs with her husband Tom Ackerley, Josey McNamara, and Sophia Kerr. LuckyChap can take a lionâs share of the credit for Robbieâs $1.4 billion 2023 smash hit Barbie (not to mention Emerald Fennellâs viral sensation Saltburn). It was the production company that threaded the almost impossible needle of turning the toy property into a good script from a credible director, Greta Gerwig, and then getting the whole improbable edifice approved by Mattel and financed by a major studio.
Those skills are obviously relevant to making a movie out of The Sims, which, like Barbie, has grown to be hugely popular without the need for any defined narrative, or even defined characters, to speak of. LuckyChap will have help in this regard from co-producers Roy Lee and Miri Yoon of Vertigo Entertainment, who produced (along with a huge number of horror flicks) the similarly challenging Lego movies, and have a hand in the forthcoming Minecraft film adaptation too.
Electronic Arts âwill also be involved in a creative and producing capacity,â according to THR, although hopefully the publisher will be able to take a back seat and let its well-chosen partners cook.
But what will they cook up? With The Sims, the skyâs the limit: Maxisâ life simulation games follow the lives of whole families and societies of Sims from birth to death in a range of scenarios from stereotypically suburban to fantastical, and tend to generate storylines that tip from mild sitcom or soap into wild surrealism. The games seem ripe for exactly the kind of meta approach Gerwig brought to Barbie. Will there be woohooing? Will the whole thing be in Simlish with subtitles? Weâll have to wait to find out â the movie doesnât have a release date yet. ",https://www.polygon.com/24107554/sims-movie-margot-robbie-kate-herron,2024-03-21 13:32:36
Age of Sigmarâs fourth edition arrives this summer with Skaven and a new game mode,"Games Workshop has debuted a new trailer teasing the fourth edition of Age of Sigmar, the fantasy tabletop game set in the ashes of Warhammer Fantasy Battlesâ Old World. The bad guys won, and basically deleted The Old World â but the divine Sigmar, along with a cast of key characters, helped forge new realms where mortals could take refuge. This trailer shows a battle between Sigmarâs chosen, the Stormcast Eternals, and it heralds the return of the fan-favorite Skaven. 
Skaven are so popular because while theyâre horrifying beasts who can rip people limb from limb, theyâre also silly little guys. Skaven are inventors who constantly blow themselves up, and they pair their potent tech with swarms of minions. A Skaven-like beast even showed up in the Warhammer 40,000 Necromunda game, so fans of evil rats are feasting right now.
While they are funny little fiends, theyâre also a massive threat to the setting, and must not be underestimated. The Skaven are a big reason for the previous worldâs fall, which saw the Great Horned Rat ascend to become the fifth Chaos god. Thatâs an unprecedented level of success for any faction  â let alone one made up of angry, gnashing, evil rats. Their hidden realm, the Gnaw, has now exploded outward into the Mortal Realm of Aqshy, and the Skaven have gone from hiding in sewers and barrels to operating in the open.
The Stormcast are holy warriors of Sigmar and defenders of humanity. A major theme for the fourth edition of Age of Sigmar is the idea that Sigmar lied: The Stormcast Eternal come back to life when they die, but they are irrevocably changed before being sent back into battle. This immortality was sold as a blessing, but it seems like itâs much more of a curse, as every reforging destroys a piece of the Stormcastâs soul. The trailer shows a Reclusian Stormcast, which is an Eternal who has almost had their soul depleted. These warriors are sealed away in holy places, as any battle could be their last.
The fourth edition of Age of Sigmar is set to arrive in summer 2024, and it comes with a new gameplay type called Spearhead. While we donât know a lot about that yet, we expect it to be a short-form, streamlined take on the full-fat experience â not unlike the Combat Patrol game mode introduced recently with the 10th edition of Warhammer 40,000. Games Workshop said in a news release that Spearhead games should only take an hour to play, and that every tabletop faction will be able to build a Spearhead army.

Converseâs new D&D collection of high tops and other gear are a critical success,"Converse is partnering with Dungeons & Dragons to celebrate the legendary tabletop franchise's 50th anniversary with a hot new collection of shoes and other gear that will be available online starting April 11. For those attending this yearâs Gary Con, the popular Dungeons & Dragons fan event celebrating its co-creator Gary Gygax, theyâll be available there on March 21.
Converseâs new products display a clear understanding of the assignment. Just look at the designs, which draw inspiration and incorporate details from first editions of D&Dâs Playerâs Handbook, Monster Manual, and the Dungeon Masters Guide. 
Naturally, the collection includes several limited-edition âChuck 70â style canvas and leather high top sneakers. The two leather high top designs feature an alternate version of the Chuck Taylor All-Star logo, designed to resemble a D20 instead. The canvas designs feature some other fun details, like illustrations of Kelek the Sorcerer, Warduke the Fighter, and Zarak the Assassin from the D&D action figures made in the 1980âs.
Some of the patterns, illustrations, and other unique elements will even be ported over to Converse By You, letting you apply them to your own bespoke apparel designs. To top it all off, the box that these high tops ship in has lovingly been transformed into a Mimic.
In addition to the special-edition high tops, Converseâs D&D collection will include a trucker hat, shorts, a sweatshirt, and three T-shirts. The hat and shorts feature the demonic face found on the cover of the playerâs guide for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, but my personal favorite is the light green tee that features a Gelatinous Cube, which is consuming the Chuck Taylor logo.
Converse hasnât revealed any pricing information surrounding the collection just yet, but as someone who wore Chuck Taylors to their wedding, I canât wait to pick up a pair for myself.",https://www.polygon.com/2024/3/20/24107034/converse-dungeons-dragons-chuck-taylor-fashion-collection-high-tops,2024-03-20 21:11:09
Captain America and Black Panther square off in new look at Marvelâs WWII action game,"Marvelâs World War II-era game that will see Captain America and Black Panther square off (and team up, natch) got a big reveal on Wednesday. Skydance New Media and Marvel Games revealed the gameâs title, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, and a 2025 release date in a new trailer for the narrative-driven action-adventure.
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydraâs trailer was revealed at Epic Gamesâ State of Unreal keynote, showing off the gameâs visuals, which are powered by the latest iteration of Unreal Engine 5. The trailer also revealed more about the gameâs setting and four playable characters: young Steve Rogers, aka Captain America; Azzuri, the WWII-era Black Panther and TâChallaâs grandfather; Gabriel Jones, a U.S. soldier and member of the Howling Commandos; and Nanali, a Wakandan spy.
Skydance New Media and Marvel also announced the gameâs primary cast, which includes Khary Payton as Azzuri/Black Panther, Drew Moerlein as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke as Nanali, and Marque Richardson as Gabriel Jones. Lyne RenÃ©e plays Julie, described as âa key ally in the French Resistance,â and Joel Johnstone portrays WWII-era Howard Stark.
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will be the first game from Skydance New Media, which is led by Amy Hennig, the former creative director of the Uncharted series and Visceral Gamesâ unfinished Star Wars game, and Electronic Arts veteran Julian Beak. The studio announced its Marvel project in 2021 as âa narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure game, featuring a completely original story and take on the Marvel Universe.â Skydance New Media is also developing an untitled Star Wars game.

You can now make and share your own Lego islands in Fortnite,"Epic Games is launching a set of tools for Unreal Editor for Fortnite thatâll let players create their own Lego islands. Epic and Lego announced the tools during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday. 
A bunch of Lego assets are now available within the Unreal Editor for Fortnite, alongside four templates to play with. Additionally, Lego has also created three of its own Fortnite islands: Lego Prop Hunt, a Lego take on the hide and seek-esque prop hunt set in a shopping mall; Lego Battle Arena, a Ninja-themed competition; and Lego Cat Island Adventure, an island where youâre tasked with taking care of a sweet little cat. Everything built in Fortnite must have an ESRB rating of E10+ or PEGI 7 â basically, theyâve got to comply with Fortniteâs family friendly rules.
These are in addition to Lego Raft Survival and Lego Obby Fun from February.
âTodayâs announcement is a hugely important step in us democratizing creativity and putting the power of the LEGO brand into creatorsâ hands like never before,â Lego Game head of play and creator growth Kari Vinther Nielsen said in a statement. âWe want kids and families to be able to enjoy a whole host of fun and engaging play experiences within Fortnite, and the potential this news offers for creators is incredibly exciting â we canât wait to see what everyone builds and how much the community enjoys the creations.â
Lego Fortnite went live in late 2023 and has continued to grow since then, part of of Legoâs $1 billion investment into Fortnite maker Epic Games.
Though Fortnite has millions less players than Roblox â 100 million to 250 million monthly players, respectively â Epic is aiming to be the next leader in user-generated content. Giving players the ability to create their own games and experiences means Fortnite, like Roblox, is more than just a game. Itâs a platform. To incentivize players to create on Fortnite, Epic gives 40% of its net revenues back to creators in what it calls âCreator Economy 2.0.â Epic issues payments based off âpopularity, engagement, retention, [and] attracting new players,â Epic executive vice president of Fortnite Saxs Persson said in 2023. 
Epic and Legoâs investment into user-generated content for Fortnite is another serious push into taking on the likes of Roblox and Minecraft, and perhaps, a sign of whatâs to come in the future â more overall industry investment in a new way of creating. Adopt Me creator  and Roblox developer Josh Ling told GameDiscover.co in May 2023 that the wider video game industry has âlittleâ understanding of user-generated content on Minecraft, Fortnite, and Roblox.
âThere were 8 million peak concurrent players on Roblox last weekend,â Ling said. âThe 2 top Roblox games regularly have half a million [CCU] each. I think most people think these platforms are undercooked, and I get it: Minecraft is block punching, Fortnite is Naruto hitting the griddy, and the average Roblox game has the aesthetics of a Lego game on PS2. But these are real platforms with real players â real toolsets that offer real value. Robloxâs [integrated development environment] is closer to Unity than it is to Scratch or Twine.â
Lego islands in Fortnite is a no-brainer for creator-driven content â brick building translates perfectly into the digital environment â and Epicâs new tools means Fortnite can capitalize on that.

Disney Lorcana announces Ursulaâs Return set and a new cooperative game,"The next set of cards for Disney Lorcana is called Ursulaâs Return, and it will include characters from Encanto for the very first time. The set arrives at local retailers as expected on May 17, with a wider retail release on May 31 at places like Target and Amazon. The announcement, made live on Twitch Wednesday, also included news about a brand-new cooperative game called Illumineerâs Quest - Deep Trouble.
Encanto card previews featured in the livestream include main characters from the movie: Mirabel, Bruno, Dolores, Felix, Julieta, and Luisa. But the bigger reveal by far was the announcement of Illumineerâs Quest, a new cooperative way to play Disney Lorcana. The boxed game comes with two new decks filled with new cards, such as Mulan, Elite Archer; Mickey, Playful Sorcerer; and Yen Sid, Powerful Sorcerer. It also features a secret envelope, presumably with a card inside, thatâs said to continue the gameâs storyline.
From the official description of Illumineerâs Quest - Deep Trouble:
The game follows the Illumineers as they track down the malevolent glimmer Ursula to her lair at the edge of Lorcana. Unfortunately, Ursula has been preparing for the Illumineersâ arrival by entangling other glimmers with mind control as well as causing natural disasters to create seemingly impossible obstacles. It will take every bit of the Illumineersâ skill and teamwork to keep Ursula from cementing her hold on the realm of Lorcana. The game includes a guided gameplay area for Ursula, two preconstructed Disney Lorcana TCG player decks (featuring Disneyâs Mulan and Yen Sid and built with cards from the first four Disney Lorcana TCG sets) and a fierce Ursula deck. This sea witch plays by her own rules.  
Ravensburger added that the $59.99 game can be played solo, with up to two players using the included preconstructed decks, or as many as four players, if fans use decks that are already in their collection. Illumineerâs Quest has four difficulty levels, and players will be able to customize their decks to increase their chances â especially useful at the gameâs most extreme difficulty level.
Incidentally, the new Mickey and Yen Sid â the elder sorcerer depicted in the âSorcererâs Apprenticeâ segment of Fantasia â both call back to the original Disney Lorcana set released in 2023, which included plenty of brooms just waiting for someone to control them en masse. All of the cards are expected to also be usable in the main, competitive game mode as well.
A serialized version of Mickey Mouse, Brave Little Tailor with a golden foil treatment will be up for grabs for those who make it into the top four in Disney Lorcana Challenge, the gameâs upcoming competitive circuit. Additional cards and playmats, included in the gallery above, will be given to other players who land among the top 64 competitors at certain events.
Disney Lorcana Challenge events are open to all players who purchase a ticket. The competition will initially be capped at 512 players. The first two U.S. events will be held on May 25-26 in Atlanta and June 8-9 in Chicago. Tickets are expected to go on sale soon. 
Update: Polygon has added additional details and clarifications based on a Ravensburger news release.",https://www.polygon.com/24106896/disney-lorcana-ursulas-return-encanto-illumineers-quest,2024-03-20 17:24:16
Stardew Valley 1.6âs goofiest patch notes and updates,"Sure, there are plenty of useful things and thereâs plenty of new content in Stardew Valleyâs 1.6 update. But there are also a lot of goofy changes to the eight-year-old game that are both helpful and hilarious. Alongside the new festivals, updated dialogue, and lots of secrets, Stardew Valley also now lets us put hats on cats and drink mayonnaise. What else could you want?
The Stardew Valley 1.6 update patch notes are pages and pages long, but weâve dug through them to find the silliest updates thatâll definitely make you smile as you play, whether youâre starting a new save or diving back into your old farm. My personal favorites are related my in-game spouses: After marriage, spouses will be prevented from laying in bed all day for seven days â a âhoneymoonâ period â if theyâre upset. Invisible spouses (a bug!) wonât ask to have children, either. 
Hereâs the list of our favorites.
Understandable! No one wants to be depressed after their wedding.
You can toss your baby once a day to up your friendship level â one heart per day. But the change for a crit likely means that you have a chance now to gain more hearts with a baby toss.
Again, another change that just makes sense. If youâre wearing clown shoes, theyâve got to jingle.
Itâs unconscionable that this wasnât in the game before. Give all cats and dogs hats!
Look, Iâm not sure who is trying to drink mayonnaise, but big ups for being able to eat pickles. The mayo change, apparently, is pretty good for the early game, thanks to the new Meadowlands farm type. Normal quality mayo gives 50 energy and 22 health, according to a player on Reddit. Get drinking!
Your ghost spouse wonât ask to have children.
I donât know about you, but if I collapse while wearing my swimsuit, I want to immediately change. ",https://www.polygon.com/24106788/stardew-valley-1-6-funny-patch-notes,2024-03-20 16:50:00
"Alien Romulus trailer brings the franchise back to straight horror, 45 years later","Alien is one of the timeless films, a movie just as lived-in and horrifying today as it was when it premiered in 1979. Ridley Scottâs seminal horror film has gone on to be many other things since becoming a full-blown franchise, from the landmark sci-fi action of the James Cameron-directed sequel to the slasher shlock of the rightfully maligned Alien vs. Predator: Requiem. 
The franchiseâs best moments, however, are steeped in pure paranoid horror, and the highly-anticipated Alien: Romulus looks like it wants to bring us right back there. 
Evil Dead (2013) and Donât Breathe director Fede Alvarezâs take on Alien is set between Alien and Aliens, and said to follow âa group of young people on a distant world, who find themselves in a confrontation with the most terrifying life form in the universe.â
The moody new trailer looks like itâs starting from square one, making facehuggers â baby aliens! not even full grown! â the primary terror here, with only a brief flash of an actual Xenomorph. 
In other words, Alvarez may have actually nailed it. 
Alien: Romulus opens in theaters on Aug. 16.

Stardew Valley smashes its Steam player records after 1.6 update release,"It should be no surprise: Stardew Valley, despite being released in 2016, is still wildly popular. In fact, itâs more popular than ever. Following the Stardew Valley 1.6 update published yesterday, the farm-and-life simulator hit a peak Steam concurrent player count of 147,612 â thatâs more than double the peak concurrent players at the gameâs launch in 2016. Stardew Valleyâs previous Steam record was just under 100,000 players after the 1.5 update launched in late 2020, according to SteamDB. Stardew Valley is the eighth most played game on Steam at the time of writing, just a few thousand players below Grand Theft Auto 5.
Crucially, this doesnât include people that own the game through GOG, or the people who intend to play on Windows PC through Xbox Game Pass. (Stardew Valley players on console have to wait a bit longer for the update.) Though we donât have exact numbers for all players, itâs clear that Stardew Valley is bigger than ever.
So whatâs in the update thatâs got everyone heading back to the game? The patch is actually bigger than expected, and the patch notes are very long. There are new festivals, a new farm type specific to animals, new quest lines, a bookseller, and hundreds of new items. Thatâs not the mention the doubled multiplayer spots, balance changes, bug fixes, and the secrets and Easter eggs that arenât explicitly mentioned in the patch notes.

"After being delisted in 2019, Segaâs Alpha Protocol is back","The ambitious, yet flawed Alpha Protocol is available for purchase once again. The 2010 game, which was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Sega, was removed from all platforms in 2019 because Segaâs music licensing rights had expired. The game is making a comeback as a DRM-free exclusive on GOG.com, available today for $19.99, with an additional 10% launch discount lasting through April 3. 
Whatâs now available is a definitive edition, of sorts, containing all of its original music, as well as support for modern wireless controllers (including the DualSense, Switch Pro controller, and Xbox Series X controllers), text localization support for 8 languages, Windows 10 and 11 compatibility, and cloud save support. The game also sports achievements on GOG, which were previously only available on consoles. What this re-release of Alpha Protocol is not, however, is a remaster. The visuals and core game are unchanged. GOG.com produced a mini documentary on how it brought the game back, and Iâve embedded it at the top of the post.
Alpha Protocolâs return to an online game store is a rare thing to see in the news cycle, especially in 2024 when itâs more often to hear stories of the opposite happening. For instance, in early March, Warner Bros. Discovery surprised indie devs with the news that games published under its Adult Swim Games label would be âretired.â
Polygon reached out to Sega to see if itâs planning to bring this updated version of Alpha Protocol to more platforms, but it didnât respond in time for publication.

World of Warcraft rides the current pirate trend into a new battle royale,"Blizzard has been hinting that something pirate-y is coming to World of Warcraft for weeks now, sneaking little Jolly Roger flags into road maps. We donât have room for a full pirate expansion, not with the Worldsoul Saga scheduled to take up the next three slots for expansion packs. Instead, weâre getting something highly experimental â a new six week battle royale called Plunderstorm.
Plunderstorm kicks off with Patch 10.2.6, and itâs going to be chaotic. Not only has this mode been hidden from test servers and data miners, but itâs basically unprecedented in terms of the usual World of Warcraft updates. Plunderstorm will have new servers, which require making a new character. Players do need a subscription to hop into Plunderstorm, but they do not need to own Dragonflight, which makes this a fun diversion for Classic and Dragonflight players alike. 
Upon logging in, youâll be greeted by a Plunderstorm logo hanging out next to the Warcraft logo. Upon selection, the player will be sent off on a parrot. Plunderstorm takes place in Arathi Basin, a familiar environment to anyone whoâs enjoyed a few battlegrounds from back in the day. The game mode is inspired by the Warcraft 3 meta of taking your hero around to little camps, killing monsters and leveling up. If players want, they can focus entirely on PvP â but if you want the eventâs sweet, sweet rewards, you can also stick to these PvE challenges.
Leveling up brings new abilities, a mix and match combination of past legendary spells, Covenant abilities, and tons of talents from each class. Everyone can double jump, no one takes fall damage, and everyone is packing a wacky kit of abilities. For instance, one particular skill lets you pretend to be a shrub to set up the ultimate ambush.
Because Plunderstorm is a battle royale, there will always be one last champion standing. Winning a match can earn you a tabard and an eye patch. All other rewards are earned over the course of playing, so the new mode hopefully shouldnât require try-hard concentration and commitment. The rewards are, as you might have guessed, pirate themed â a pirate outfit for Pepe, a parrot, a crab, transmog items, and the Traderâs Tender currency.
Plunderstorm launches today, and will run for the next six weeks. The experimental game mode may return in future, based on player feedback.",https://www.polygon.com/24106179/world-of-warcraft-patch-10-2-6-plunderstorm-battle-royale-pirates,2024-03-19 20:28:38
"If your love for Pikachu is limitless, take it to the next level with this huge plush","Itâs not the biggest Pikachu plush ever made, but it is big! At 26 inches, or just over two feet, The PokÃ©mon Companyâs new big Pikachu plush is available for pre-order on The PokÃ©mon Center website. The $199.99 plush toy is expected to ship in September 2024, according to the product page.
âThis jumbo-sized Pikachu is big enough to battle, but soft enough to hug,â according to The PokÃ©mon Company. âYou can show off your PokÃ©mon pride with one of our largest PokÃ© Plush ever. Embroidered details and soft fabric help bring Pikachu to life in a huge way!â
Pikachu is 26 3â4 inches tall and 24 1â2 inches wide. It doesnât size up quite as large as the older, $249.99 Pikachu plush that was over three feet tall. To compare this new Pikachu to another massive PokÃ©mon plush, itâs a little smaller than the life-sized Psyduck, and drastically smaller than the gigantic Wailord. It is, however, bigger than the line of sleeping Eevee evolutions (which are sold out, unfortunately) that clock in at 16 inches a piece. Pikachuâs PokÃ©dex entry lists its height at just over a foot, so the new plush is still bigger than average. Itâs the biggest PokÃ©mon plushie you can buy from The PokÃ©mon Center at the time of writing. So, if youâre looking for jumbo, this is it.
A cheaper option thatâs nearly just as huggable is the 14-inch Pikachu Squishmallow that costs under $50 Itâs smaller than the 20-inch version that I have, but not by much. But if cost is no limit, Iâd rather have a 16-inch fat Pikachu plush â we love a round king.

Stardew Valley 1.6 update is out â hereâs what in it,"Stardew Valleyâs 1.6 update is finally out. Players on Windows PC can download the patch now. Developer Eric âConcernedApeâ Barone has been sharing small updates daily, but the full patch notes are up on the Stardew Valley website. Whatâs coming to Stardew Valley with the 1.6 patch? Two mini fishing festivals, a three-day spring festival, and an âeventâ for summer, alongside a whole bunch of other content, features, and improvements. Despite the patch notes being exceptionally long, the update is 53.7MB.
If youâre looking to stay spoiler-free before heading back to your farm, you may want to stop reading â the full patch notes are full of information. Some of the highlights include a new farm type, called Meadowlands Farm: It lets you start with a chicken coop and two chickens, and it has âchewy blue grass that animals love.â Stardew Valley is also getting a âmasteryâ system that gives players âpowerful perks and items,â and is accessible in a new area of the game, plus a Big Chest â more storage! â a new quest with new neighbors, a prize machine with rewards, four home renovations, new cat and dog breeds (and the ability to have multiple pets), and eight new achievements. Most importantly, you can put hats on cats and dogs now.

Somewhere in Stardew Valley, Barone has also added new secrets and Easter eggs, he said in the patch notes.
Stardew Valley will now also let you host up to eight players for multiplayer on PC, with better performance and stability overall.

Falloutâs first look has a Vault Dweller-Ghoul-Brotherhood showdown,"Fallout, the new TV show based on the game series (also called Fallout), will be a show about a lot of things: post-apocalyptic survival, weird nuclear creatures, old-timey music, and, as Fallout co-showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet has said, factionalism. Nowhere is that clearer than the new preview scene Prime Video dropped ahead of the showâs April 12 premiere.
Freshly sprung from vault life, we see Lucy (Ella Purnell) is not exactly picking her battles â or, at least, not picking them well. In the scene, she confronts The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) with some patented Vault Dweller de-escalation tactics. And though she is finally above ground, she is still decidedly out of her depths. 
According to Purnell, that trait is one of the things that excited her about the role. 
âShe is so innocent and so naive and obviously very privileged as well,â Purnell says. âSheâs essentially a newborn baby. She hasnât had any real life experiences. All she knows is what she was taught and what sheâs read in books that she has in the vault. 
âIt was really exciting for me to start in that place.â
Luckily for this turn at least, a Brotherhood of Steel member shows up to assist Lucy (though we donât get to see what becomes of it). Still, itâs the first real showcase of how the world of Fallout looks and â bless up â how the Brotherhood of Steel armor moves. Frankly, it looks great, and it elicits the same reaction from me as it does from the Ghoul (albeit with a different tone): Are you fucking kidding me!
Ultimately, the scene gets home what Robertson-Dworet wanted with the idea of factions defining Fallout. 
âWhen you play the game Fallout, you go from settlement to settlement or from faction to faction. And that was something that we were really excited to manifest with our heroes,â Robertson-Dworet said in a press conference earlier this month. âElla being the Vault Dweller, Aaron [Moten] being the Brotherhood of Steel member, and Walton being sort of the character that, you know, nobody really cares about, the ghouls in the wasteland. But in a way that makes them, of course, the most empathetic.â
Fallout will premiere on April 12 â or technically April 11, depending on your time zone. (Itâll be released at midnight EDT, meaning it comes out at 9 p.m. PDT the Thursday before its release date.) All of the episodes will drop at once.",https://www.polygon.com/24105948/fallout-tv-first-look-scene-new-amazon-prime-video,2024-03-19 18:24:20
Diablo 4 is joined by a huge slate of titles coming to Xbox Game Pass,"Xbox is jumping into spring with a huge slate of games coming to Xbox Game Pass. Starting today, the service will be getting Lightyear Frontier, a space exploration and farming sim with a mech, and MLB The Show 24, which also launched Tuesday across platforms and will feature women players for the first time in franchise history.
Arguably the biggest addition, though, is Diablo 4 on March 28, the first new Activision Blizzard title to hit Game Pass since Microsoftâs acquisition of the company was completed last year. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said that players shouldnât expect all Activision Blizzard games to drop onto Game Pass the moment the deal was finalized, but this signals the start of more additions to come. New Diablo 4 players will also have plenty of time to play this RPG for dozens of hours before the paid DLC Vessel of Hatred releases later this year.
Thereâs also Supermassive Gamesâ The Quarry, a previous PS5 console exclusive and spiritual successor to Until Dawn. This time, a group of teenage counselors have to survive a night at an abandoned camp while being stalked by violent creatures and mysterious locals. As the player, you have to make a series of choices on behalf of all the characters to try and ensure everybody makes it out alive. (Spoiler alert: Itâs very unlikely you will succeed.)
If none of those games are for you, this is still a very packed list of new titles for the rest of March into April. Hereâs the full list:
As you can imagine, with the release of MLB The Show 24, last yearâs MLB The Show 23 will be leaving Xbox Game Pass at the end of the month, along with two other games:
Xbox Game Pass costs $10.99 a month, while PC Game Pass costs $9.99 a month. PC Game Pass includes EA Play access, which offers another 70 games on PC. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, at $16.99 per month, gives subscribers access to everything â the PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass libraries, EA Play on both console and PC â as well as access to online multiplayer. Xbox Game Pass Core (formerly called Xbox Live Gold) costs $9.99 per month or $59.99 per year.",https://www.polygon.com/24105782/xbox-game-pass-march-april-2024-new-additions,2024-03-19 16:15:00
It looks like Star Wars is finally getting its Watchmen in The Acolyte,"Itâs been a while since our last new Star Wars show. But the long drought since Ahsoka is finally coming to an end as Disney debuted the first trailer for The Acolyte on Tuesday. The new series is set during Star Warsâ High Republic era and will debut on Disney Plus with its first two episodes on June 4.
The trailer starts by showing us a Jedi talking to a class of younglings, asking them to reach out to the Force and say what they feel. From there the focus quickly shifts to reveal a murder plot: Someone is killing off Jedi all around the Galaxy. The main thrust of the show, it seems, is to investigate these murders and capture the culprit behind them. One of the things that makes Star Wars: The Acolyte unique is that itâs set during the High Republic era, a time about 100 years before The Phantom Menace. 
The Acolyte doesnât quite look like anything else in Star Wars, at least based on this first trailer. Itâs dark and moody, and with all the focus on the gritty Jedi murder-mystery investigation at its core, itâs hard not to feel like itâs got quite a strong Watchmen influence. Beyond that, between the Force-based martial arts we see in the trailer and the High Republic setting, there should be plenty of other new and unique vibes in The Acolyte. If thatâs not enough for you, then the trailer even gives us a brief glimpse of Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo), a Wookiee Jedi master.
The series is created by Leslye Headland (Russian Doll) and stars Amandla Stenberg (The Hunger Games), Lee Jung-jae (Squid Game), Manny Jacinto (Top Gun: Maverick), Dafne Keen (Logan), and Carrie-Ann Moss (The Matrix).

Overwatch 2 will stop locking new heroes behind a battle pass with season 10,"The next season of Overwatch 2 will introduced a new hero, Venture, and a new way to unlock them. Instead of having to pay for the gameâs premium battle pass or unlock that new hero through dozens of hours of gameplay, Blizzard will make Venture and all future heroes available to free for all players when they launch.
Overwatch 2 players will also get free access to all of the gameâs previously released heroes, including characters like Mauga, Illari, and Lifeweaver, when season 10 launches in April. New players will still need to complete the first-time user experience to unlock heroes, Blizzard says, but âonce the heroes from the original Overwatch roster have been unlocked, all Overwatch 2 heroes will also become available.â
Thatâs a big change from the original (and controversial) structure of locking new Overwatch heroes behind a paywall or progression. Itâs one of a handful of changes to how Blizzard is handling the gameâs battle pass, game director Aaron Keller revealed in a new video.
Starting with season 10, Blizzard will also make Mythic skins previously released through Overwatch 2âs paid battle pass available for direct purchase. Pricing and launch details on the gameâs new Mythic Shop are still forthcoming, but hereâs what Blizzard said in a new blog post about the shop:
The Mythic Shop will allow you to work towards past and current seasonal Mythic hero skins as you progress through the Premium Battle Pass. You get to decide how far into each Mythic skin you would like to build. So, for example, if you donât want to fully unlock all of a skinâs color or model variations, you can spread your progression towards other Mythic hero skins.
Additionally, starting with season 10, players will be able to earn Overwatch Coins â the gameâs premium currency â through the free and premium tracks of the gameâs battle pass. (Blizzard currently rewards Overwatch Credits through the pass.) Players will be able to earn up to 600 coins per season, up from 540. Previously, those coins could be earned by completing weekly challenges, but Blizzard says those challenges will now earn players battle pass XP. 
Season 10 will also bring new game mode Clash and its new map Hanaoka to Overwatch 2 with a limited-time trial. The full Clash mode is expected to launch sometime this year with two maps.

MrBeast has a TV deal with Amazonâs Prime Video to produce a record-breaking TV game show,"Jimmy âMrBeastâ Donaldson is teaming up with Amazon MGM Studios to create a fully-fledged reality TV show of his own: Beast Games. The game show competition will pit âover 1,000â contestants against each other in a chance to win a $5 million cash prize, a release said. Beast Games does not have a release window yet, but it will debut worldwide exclusively to Amazonâs Prime Video service. 
Donaldson is set to be the host and will serve as an executive producer on the show. We donât have many other details on the competition, but a release that said it would be based on his YouTube show. 
âMy goal is to make the greatest show possible and prove YouTubers and creators can succeed on other platforms,â Donaldson said in a release. âAmazon gave me the creative control I need to try and make it happen. I hope to make the YouTube community proud.â 
Donaldson has cultivated a massive YouTube audience via sharing over-the-top, stunt content. At time of publication, his YouTube channel has over 245 million subscribers. True to the nature of his previous content, this show appears to one-up more than a few prior projects. The show will be âbiggest reality competition series everâ with the âbiggest single prize in the history of television and streaming,â a description of the show said. 
The announcement is the next turn in a series of events that seemingly started with Netflixâs viral hit, Squid Games. Following the release of the show in 2021, Donaldson published a video that turned the fictional battle royale scenario into a real-life reality series. The video, titled â$456,000 Squid Game In Real Life!â, later became his most-viewed video ever. At the time of this writing it has well more than half a billion views. Roughly two years later, Netflix created a reality show of its own inspired by Squid Games, but released it to little fanfare. 
Donaldson was not involved with the creation of the Netflixâs reality show, but in a post on X he said he âprobably could have helped them immenselyâ with it. Time will tell if he can actually live up to that statement with Beast Games.

Steam Families adds way more features for those who share their game libraries,"As more people get Steam Decks and other handheld PC consoles, which are much easier to share among households than a PC, it was integral for Valve to make its generally barebones family-sharing settings more robust. On Monday, the company announced that Steam Families is now available in beta, adding more features for people who want to share games or control access on the platform. 
Steam Families allows a user to share their library with up to five other âfamily membersâ (or whoever you share your PC or Steam Deck with). Once you join a family, youâll automatically gain access to games the members own â  barring titles where the developers didnât opt into the program. You can also play games from another personâs library even if theyâre online playing something else. So, if youâre playing Helldivers 2, a family member can hop into Balatro at the same time.
Steam currently has two family features. They are Family Sharing, which lets you share games with your family members, and Family View, which grants parental controls. Family View, however, lacks many features other parental control systems have. It allowed users to choose whether they shared all games or only games they chose, and limited access to features like the store and friends lists. These can all be changed with a PIN. The new Steam Families will combine these two existing family features so users can not only share games but also control how those games are accessed more easily.
Valve has added some more capabilities here. Besides the aforementioned features, adults can now limit access to inappropriate games and set playtime limits for children. Steam also now offers playtime reports that show how many minutes a user has played.  A child can send a request to increase those limits or buy a title from the store, which the parent can accept or dismiss. 
Steam Families is currently only available in the Steam Beta Client. Thereâs no word on when itâll be available to the general public, but once it is Steam will automatically recommend people who can join your family.

"Poker roguelite Balatro is a hit, but announced mobile release will show its true power","Breakout 2024 poker roguelite hit Balatro is coming to Apple and Android mobile devices, according to solo developer LocalThunk. Thatâs great news for all of us currently invested in creating the highest-scoring poker hands, and bad news for our productivity related to anything else.
Publisher PlayStack announced the port during a Reddit Ask Me Anything over the weekend, although it didnât have any more details on a potential release window. In a recap thread over on the Balatro subreddit, it was confirmed LocalThunk would be working on the mobile ports. 
On Monday, the publisher also announced the game has already sold 1 million copies since it released on Feb. 20 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. It was ported to macOS on March 1.

The AMA is filled with trivia and other news for fans who canât get enough of weird poker. For example, PlayStack confirmed itâs looking into official merch, including card decks that match what you might unlock in the game. LocalThunk also announced a daily challenge mode is in the works ... or, rather, that itâs âin the cards.â 
Balatroâs success has a lot to do with its excellent game loop, where the player adds jokers and regular cards with various effects to a typical deck of 52 playing cards. The goal is to make it through eight rounds (or antes) of poker by scoring above a certain amount of points, although this becomes increasingly more difficult as you go. Your job is to craft a strategy thatâll net you the most points. Itâs also a great game to play if you like watching numbers go up, or want to brush up on some math.
Thereâs also the âskip blindâ mechanic, which allows you to skip rounds for individual rewards. You might be able to get a rarer joker in the shop, for example, or be able to get extra cash. In the AMA, Local Thunk said this was one of the hardest mechanics to get right:
When the game first went public, there was a very very basic version of this mechanic whereby skipping BOTH the small and big blinds gave you a very very paltry reward (a gold seal card). Nobody skipped for this reward in general, but the framework was in place. After the game went public this issue was exposed, and adding individual skip rewards with variety felt like the natural progression from that original idea! It was a massive improvement, and if really started feeding more into the entire ârisk vs rewardâ ideology behind Balatro. 
However, LocalThunk doesnât think there will be more mechanics added over time, although there might be âmore options, more opportunities for emergence, more secrets.â
LocalThunk also reconfirmed our story about how to pronounce the gameâs title: âItâs pronounced âBalatro.ââ
The whole AMA is worth checking out if you want more insight into Balatro, a game that might just ruin your life if you donât set some ground rules for how much you can play it each day. ",https://www.polygon.com/24104876/balatro-roguelite-mobile-release-apple-ios-android,2024-03-18 17:21:13
Apex Legends finals postponed after suffering unprecedented hack,"The North American Apex Legends finals have been postponed after hackers appeared to give competitors cheats in the middle of tournament games, in an unprecedented attack on a major esports event.
The Apex Legends esports X account said the decision to stop and postpone the event, which was running on Sunday, March 17, had been taken âdue to the competitive integrity of this series being compromised.â
Official comment on the incident ends there, but clips circulating online showed players suddenly being given cheats like aimbots and wall hacks while matches were ongoing.
One clip showed Apex pro Genburten shout âIâm getting hacked, Iâm getting hacked!â as a wall hack revealed the location of every player in the match on his screen. Genburten threw his hands up in the air, exclaimed, âItâs cheating!â and left the game as quick as he could. âWhat the fuck?â he said, visibly distressed.
NO WAY @Genburten getting hacked mid algs game pic.twitter.com/PaVOjmnEGs
In another clip, player ImperialHal found himself unable to shoot, apparently after a hacker enabled an aimbot which was then detected and blocked by the gameâs anti-cheat mechanism. âI cannot shoot, I cannot shoot,â he said.
The hackers have now given 2 Apex Legends pro players cheats in the middle of an ALGS match. ImperialHal has now also been hacked and the hacker forcibly enabled aimbot on his account mid game. Have never seen something like this in esports. pic.twitter.com/VY30Q21Dok
Thereâs no precedent for a hacking attack on a private game lobby thatâs running such a high-profile competition. In the Genburten clip, the streamerâs chat can be seen to read âApex hacking global series by Destroyer2009 & R4ndom.â
The Anti-Cheat Police Department â an X account that tracks cheating in games â identified the hack as a remote code execution (RCE) exploit that was targeting a vulnerability, either in the networking code of Apex Legends itself, or of the popular third-party anti-cheat software Apex uses, Easy Anti-Cheat.
âThere is currently an RCE exploit being abused in [Apex Legends],â the Anti-Cheat Police Department posted. âIt is unsure whether it comes from the game or the actual anti-cheat. I would advise against playing any games protected by [Easy Anti-Cheat] or any EA titles [until] they have fixed this or can comment.â
The account pointed out that if the hackers had the capability to remotely install cheats on playersâ machines, they could do much worse. âThey have the capabilities to do whatever, like installing ransomware software locking up your entire PC,â they said. They advised affected players to protect their personal information, change passwords, and perform a fresh operating system installation on their PCs.
However, the makers of Easy Anti-Cheat said they believed their software wasnât at fault. âAt this time â we are confident that there is no RCE vulnerability within EAC being exploited,â they posted on X.

League of Legendsâ saddest scorpion finally gets his long awaited rework,"League of Legendsâ champion roster has grown so big and varied over the last fifteen years that occasionally, a concept just doesnât land, or a character ages poorly. Skarner is one of these champions. A crystal scorpion from the desert region of Shurima, Skarner was the last of his kind and the source of the magical technology known as hextech. Riot Games has bestowed the sad purple scorpion with his own VGU, or visual and gameplay update. Now, Skarner emerges with three tails, for thrice the stinging, a sleek new look, new powerful abilites, and some intriguing lore.
Skarner is now the Primordial Soverign, and one of the founders of the ruling class of Ixtal. Ixtal is an isolationist nation that hides the rest of the world through powerful elemental magic, and only the elites known as the Yun Tal know the truth. Fiercely protective of his people, Skarner will go to any lengths to fight back the emerging enemies of Ixtal.
Here are Skarnerâs new abilities, which focus on the idea of combining his brute strength with the nuanced weaving of elemental magic.
Skarnerâs attacks, Shattered Earth, Upheaval, and Impale apply Quaking to enemies. Enemies with three stacks of Quaking take % Max HP damage over time.
Skarner rips a rock out of the ground and uses it to empower his next three attacks with bonus damage, range, and attack speed. His third attack slams the rock into his target, slowing and dealing significant bonus damage, ending the effect.
Skarner may re-cast Upheaval to throw the rock as a projectile that explodes on the first enemy hit, dealing the same damage and slow, ending the effect.
Skarner gains a shield and slams into the ground, releasing a shockwave that damages and slows nearby enemies.
Skarner charges forward, ignoring terrain, and grabs the first enemy champion or large monster he collides with. He may then carry them a short way, damaging and stunning them if they collide with terrain.
Skarner impales up to three enemy champions, damaging and suppressing them. Skarner gains bonus movement speed for a short time and carries them with him until the end of the effect.
The new Skarner wants to be continually attacking, using his passive to stack damage on foes, while waiting for the perfect opportunity to grab an enemy â or three, with the right use of Impale â and drag them back to his friends. 
While the old Skarner was a tragic figure, this version of the character has a certain dignity to him. One of the most famous lines from old Skarner was âI miss my kind,â but thatâs no longer the case â new Skarner has a people he loves and protects, and heâs a hugely inspirational figure to the nation. Proud papa Skarner is a great twist on the original concept, and Iâm intrigued to see whether the political division in Ixtal is explored by Riot in further releases.
Skarner arrives with Patch 14.7, but heâll be available to test on the Public Beta Environment on March 19. The new Skarner will arrive in League of Legends on April 2.",https://www.polygon.com/24102065/league-of-legends-skarner-vgu-rework-lore-abilities,2024-03-18 15:00:00
"All the Scream 7 news so far, including its new director","Ghostface has returned for yet another killing spree in Scream 6, and this time, heâs in the Big Apple. In the latest installment, the multi-identity masked killer returned to stalk the four survivors of Scream 5. Scream 6 opened to the best weekend box office of the series so far, cresting $44 million in its first few days. 
With success like that, itâs no surprise that a new entry in the series is on the way. We donât know much about Scream 7 but we know itâs happening, and involves a few creative change ups from the previous entries, including a new director. While youâre waiting, hereâs where to watch every movie in the Scream franchise.
[Ed. note: This story contains spoilers for Scream 6.]
Yes, but the details are awfully complicated. When the movie was first announced, the director was set to be Christopher Landon, the fantastic writer and director behind horror-comedies like Happy Death Day. However, after Spyglass Media fired Scream (2022) and Scream VI star Melissa Barrera over posts about the Israel-Gaza conflict which the studio deemed antisemitic, Landon left the project. 
With Landon out, the new director of the movie will be Kevin Williamson, who wrote the original Scream movie. The movie will be written by Guy Busick, who also wrote the previous two movies.
With all the upheaval around the new movie, it seems like it might be a little while. We know the script was delivered to Neve Campbell sometime around March 12, which means they could start shooting fairly soon. That being said, itâs likely we wouldnât get Scream 7 until sometime next year at the earliest. 
The directors behind the last two Scream movies, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, will both move to executive producer roles for Scream 7, along with another member of their Radio Silence film making group, Chad Villella.
Nope, she left the series shortly after Barrera was fired, but her departure was reportedly due to scheduling reasons.
This is yet another very confusing question that has yet to be answered, but we do know a few things for sure. For one thing, we know Melissa Barrera was fired, and therefore wonât be returning. We also know that on March 12, Neve Campbell announced she would be returning to the franchise as Sidney Prescott, despite a contract disagreement that kept her out of the previous entry. 
As for the rest of the cast, including Courteney Coxâs Gale Weathers and Jasmin Savoy Brown and Mason Gooding, the other members of the âCore Fourâ from the previous two movies, weâll have to wait for more official word from Spyglass Media.

The Teen Titans are getting a live-action movie in James Gunnâs new DC Universe,"James Gunn and Peter Safranâs DC Universe hasnât even had its first release, but that hasnât stopped the studio from announcing new additions. The Teen Titans are the latest heroes  getting their own live-action movie in the DCU, according to The Hollywood Reporter. 
The Vampire Diaries and Hightown actress Ana Nogueira will handle writing the script for the new movie. Nogueira is already involved with Gunn and Safranâs new superhero universe, writing the script for Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, which will star Milly Alcock (House of the Dragon) and doesnât yet have a release date. While Supergirl is Nogueiraâs first major screenwriting credit, sheâs also a playwright, her play Which Way to the Stage debuted off-Broadway in 2022.

The announcement didnât include which incarnation of the Teen Titans team would be included in the movie, though the best one is certainly Beast Boy, Cyborg, Robin, Raven, and Starfire, who starred in both the beloved Teen Titans and Teen Titans GO! animated series. 
Joining the Titans and Supergirl in the DCU are stalwarts like Superman and Batman, as well as slightly more off-the-beaten path DC characters like Swamp Thing and The Authority. The DCU will get its official launch with James Gunnâs Superman movie in 2025, with movies like The Brave and The Bold, which will focus on the Batfamily, following after that. 
Thereâs no word yet on when the Teen Titans movie might arrive, but itâs likely it wonât arrive for a least a few years.

Among Us TV show reveals cast â but not imposter,"The Among Us TV show now has a voice cast â though only time will tell which of them are imposters.
Randall Park (Fresh Off the Boat, Ant-Man) will lead the cast as Red, the captain of the spaceship. Ashley Johnson (The Last of Us, Critical Role) plays Purple, the cynical head of security, with Yvette Nicole Brown (Community) playing Orange, HR representative. And Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings, Over the Garden Wall) is Green, the unpaid intern.
Based on the hidden role game that exploded in popularity in 2020, the Among Us animated show was announced in 2023 by CBS Studios. Infinity Trainâs Owen Dennis leads the project. There have been a few previously teased images of the Among Us show, include a replica of the in-game map and a scene of a pizza party gone wrong.

Microsoft to Minecraft players: Donât update with Xbox app on PC or risk losing your world,"If youâre a Minecraft player on PC, donât update your game using the Xbox app, Microsoft warned Friday. If you do, you risk losing your Minecraft world. You can use the Xbox app to manage updates for your Windows PC and console, and sometimes it can auto-update if you donât adjust the settings. Several people responding to the Microsoft message have reported already losing their Minecraft worlds thanks to the update. 
âDo not update Minecraft through the Xbox app on PC,â Microsoft tweeted from the Mojang X (formerly Twitter) account. âIf you do, your worlds may be lost. We recommend that you run the Gaming Services Repair Tool for PC before installing the Minecraft update.â Microsoft is also warning players when they open Minecraft, according to players posting on the gameâs Reddit forum.
Microsoft said players should run the Gaming Services Repair Tool for PC in the Xbox app before installing the new Minecraft update. âUsing this tool updates the Gaming Services to version 19.87.13001.0, which will avoid the update error. Below are instructions on running the tool,â Microsoft said on its known issues page. Hereâs how:

Palworld is getting its first new Pal and raid battle ,"Palworld developer Pocketpair has announced the first new Pal to come to the game since its release in January. Itâs named Bellanoir, and this fearsome creature is coming to the game as part of the gameâs first-ever raid battle. The developers do not have a release date for the update but said it would be coming âsoon.â Pocketpair released a short trailer announcing the news via X on Friday.
Palworld is a survival game in which players can catch and work alongside PokÃ©mon-esque creatures called Pals. The game soared in popularity when the developers first released it and it quickly became one of the most popular games on Steam and Xbox Games Pass. The trailer from X shows us our first look at Bellanoir; it kind of looks like an emo version of the PokÃ©mon, Gardevoir.

This future update follows the roadmap that Pocketpair released for the game back in January. If the developers continue with this general plan, then players can expect other additional features down the line like Pal Arena, which will allow Pals to fight each other, and player-versus-player game content. So dedicated Pal tamers will likely have plenty more other challenges to look forward to in the future. ",https://www.polygon.com/24101796/palworld-new-pal-bellanoir-raid-update,2024-03-15 15:22:31
The most-played Steam Deck games list is full of amazing time sinks,"Is Baldurâs Gate 3 playable on the Steam Deck? Thatâs a resounding yes from Steam Deck owners. Larian Studiosâ 2023 hit is the most-played game on the handheld gaming device, according to Valveâs list of the top 100 games played on Steam Deck. 
The Steam Deck might not be the most ideal place to play a humongous game like Baldurâs Gate 3 â it doesnât look great and the small text can be hard to read â but its place at the top of the charts shows just how much players will put up with to play their favorite games on the go. Baldurâs Gate 3 rules, even if your Steam Deck is on the verge of overheating!
Valveâs list ranks the top 100 games in order by âhighest daily active player countâ from March 2023 to March 2024, and it includes titles that are both Steam Deck verified and not. Roguelike bullet hell game Vampire Survivors is second on the list, followed by fishing and restaurant simulator Dave the Diver, Harry Potter role-playing game Hogwarts Legacy, and fantasy Soulslike Elden Ring. Palworld, Cyberpunk 2077, Grand Theft Auto 5, Stardew Valley, and Red Dead Redemption are next on the list. 
Games like Vampire Survivors being on the list make so much sense since theyâre basically about making big numbers get bigger but on the go. Balatro, which just released in February and is an entirely different game with the same numbers ethos, is also high on the list â and itâs actually my personal favorite current time sink.
Valveâs been publishing its top Steam Deck games list for a while, most recently in December 2023. Back then, Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon topped the list, followed by Baldurâs Gate 3. The list has a lot of overlap with this one, but some notable 2024 releases that broke in are Palworld, Balatro, Helldivers 2, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, Persona 3 Reload, Last Epoch, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and Granblue Fantasy: Relink â in that order.
Steam Deck or not, a lot of these top 100 games are also now discounted as part of the 2024 spring sale. You can get the entire top 25 games â except Elden Ring â on sale, including Cult of the Lamb, Balatro, Baldurâs Gate 3, Hades, The Witcher 3, and plenty more.",https://www.polygon.com/24101163/steam-deck-100-most-played-games-2023-valve,2024-03-14 21:04:40
EA is giving away The Sims 4âs backyard pack for free,"Starting Thursday, The Sims 4 publisher Electronic Arts is giving away the Backyard Stuff pack for free across all platforms (EA App, PlayStation, Steam, and Xbox) until April 13.
Backyard Stuff was originally released in 2016 on Mac and Windows PC, and was added to consoles in 2018. As you might have guessed, itâs centered around the backyard: Alongside a shark slip-and-slide, itâs got potted plants, a bird feeder, and other patio add-ons. Of course, thereâs added casual fashion and hairstyles, too â you know, stuff youâd wear in the backyard. Overall,  itâs a cute pack, and perfect timing as we head out of winter and into spring.
Like all Stuff Packs, it originally cost $10. The Sims 4 has several types of downloadable content, the biggest of which is an expansion pack. Then thereâs the Game Pack, which typically adds gameplay elements but not enough to make it an expansion. Stuff Pack follows, adding a bunch of new objects and clothes. In total, The Sims 4 has at least 15 expansions, 12 Game Packs, and 20 Stuff Packs â thatâs $200 alone if you wanted all the Stuff Packs, meaning itâs pretty expensive to get all available content. One free pack every so often wonât mitigate that price a lot, but itâs something! 
The Sims 4âs last Stuff Pack â albeit not free â is the Crystal Creations Stuff Pack, which adds a way for your Sims to make jewelry from crystals and gemstones. You can also get other The Sims 4 content on sale on the official website on Steam during the platformâs spring sale.

All the Netflix Avatar: The Last Airbender season 2 news weâve heard so far,"Aang and his friends are on a quest to stop the Fire Nation in the first season of Netflixâs Avatar: The Last Airbender. But thereâs plenty more to the story than just the first season, which was released on Netflix on Thursday. In fact, if the animated original series is anything to go by, there should be at least two more seasons in Aangâs journey.
And Netflix has confirmed that suspicion. The streamer has made its plans for Avatarâs future official, so hereâs everything we know about the live-action Netflix Avatar: The Last Airbender season 2.
On March 6, just a few weeks after the showâs debut, Netflix announced that Avatar: The Last Airbender is moving forward with not just one, but two more seasons. This means that the show should be able to complete the entire run of the original series, which also ran three seasons.
Albert Kim told Entertainment Weekly that the live-action version altered the story slightly in order to allow some space between seasons 1 and 2, since the young actors will age quickly and noticeably in between filming. With planning like that, itâs clear that Kim at least has already thinking about the rest of the show from day one. 
With Netflixâs renewal coming so quickly, itâs possible that the cast and crew hop right back to work and get the showâs next season done quickly. While thereâs still only a slim possibility that the show could come back right away, with a new season debuting in 2025, itâs much more likely that weâd be waiting until 2026 to see Aang and the gangâs story continue. The good news is that it wonât take nearly as long as it did for the first season to go from announcement to debut, especially considering that the cast could quickly age out of their roles â just like the kids from Stranger Things.

The first season of the live-action show pretty closely follows the first season of the animated series, so itâs a good guess that weâll probably get a pretty faithful adaptation of season 2 next time around. The one major change made by the creative team of Netflixâs Avatar: The Last Airbender was to add more Azula into season 1, which could mean that she also has an increased role in season 2, but we wonât know that for sure until the new season arrives.
But one thing is clear. There will be more of a time difference between season 1 and season 2 of the Netflix ATLA than the original show. Speaking to Polygon, showrunner Albert Kim says that the writing team went into season 1 fully knowing that any future seasons would have more time elapsed between, and the actors would get noticeably older. So, team accommodated a possible time skip between seasons while working on season 1. 
âWe wanted to account for the fact that Aang will have grown a little more than he would have in the original show,â he explains. âSo one of the things that I know that fans are already noticing in season 1 is: Aang does not really do much waterbending, if at all in season 1. Because we actually wanted to, for one thing, slow down his bending education, [and] it gives us a little more time to do that. And we knew we would have more time.â
Kim also says that the next two seasons of the show present a different challenge than the first season. For one, the gaang bounces all over the map. But for another, the episodes are way more serialized than the cartoon.
âItâs both easier and harder to adapt, because there is a throughline but it means that every story kind of counts,â he says. âAs opposed to season 1, where we had to leave some certain stories out and certain adventures and episodes out. But it did not necessarily disrupt the overall arc of the season because they were so self contained.â
So unlike season 1, which had a lot of shuffling of plotlines and characters, season 2 might be more by-the-book. 
The first and last answer here is really all that matters: Who is Netflix going to find to play Toph? The fan-favorite character will be season 2âs big addition, and the news of her casting is likely to be the most important pre-release information we find out, other than the seasonâs release date of course. 
Absolutely. Whether you liked season 1 of the live-action show or not, the animated version is quite a bit better and a whole lot more fun, so you should check it out if you havenât yet â or revisit it if itâs been a few years. Legend of Korra is also great, if youâre still hungry for more Avatar action before season 2 arrives. 
Live-action adaptations of animated series arenât easy to pull off, but One Piece is arguably the best Netflix has done so far. The series canât quite match the fun of the animated series, and like ATLA, it excises some of the most fun elements of the story, like the quiet moments of the crew getting to know each other better. But, despite those flaws, One Piece is still pretty good and definitely worth a watch.

"God of War is now DRM-free on GOG, proving once again that Sonyâs all in on PC","God of War on PC just hit an important milestone that would have seemed extremely unlikely 6 years ago when the game launched on PS4: itâs now available DRM-free via GOG.com (and itâs half-off at $24.99 for the rest of the month, to boot). The title has joined an impressive group of other PC games that were once exclusive to PlayStation consoles â all of which are completely free of DRM (digital rights management), software that is typically used to prevent piracy and mods. Currently, Days Gone, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection are each discounted, as well.

Sonyâs decision to bring some of its PlayStation games to PC is nothing new, nor is its work to eventually remove DRM from select titles to list them on GOGâs site. Nevertheless, thereâs something exciting about seeing new games get added to the DRM-free pile. In doing so, Sony is expressing that it is content for its games to exist outside the control of any storeâs platform, so long as people pay for them. Ironically, this is something that Xbox Game Studios currently does, to a much less impressive degree. 
Itâs true that most PC gamers use Steam to buy and play games, but offering DRM-free titles is what fully committing to PC as a platform looks like. Kudos, Sony.

Sony Santa Monicaâs hit revival of the God of War series was (and still is, if you want to experience God of War RagnarÃ¶k) one of the main reasons to buy a PlayStation console. The steady stream of Sony-published games coming to PC is changing that slightly. The companyâs big 2024 hit, Helldivers 2, hit Steam the same day as the PS5 versionâs launch. Sonyâs next big title to make the platform leap is Ghost of Tsushima. Sucker Punch Productionâs excellent open-world title is coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store (EGS) in May. Maybe Marvelâs Spider-Man 2 is next? 
But when will these games become DRM-free and head to GOG? Thatâs hard to predict. Going off of God of Warâs 6-year timeline, the PC port came to Steam at the beginning of 2022, after it was a console-exclusive game for 4 years. Other games made the transition much quicker. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection came to GOG in December 2023, a little more than a year after its Steam and EGS debut. However long the wait is to get more DRM-free titles, GOGâs Zuzanna Rybacka told Polygon that a vocal community plays a major role in accelerating its negotiations with Sony to get more games on its storefront â that, and having an ace business development team. 
Correction: The article originally stated that The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered was already available on PC, but that was incorrect.",https://www.polygon.com/deals/24100659/god-of-war-drm-free-gog-sony-playstation-deal,2024-03-14 14:54:49
"SimCity, Metroid, and Neopets (and 9 others) nominated for Video Game Hall of Fame","The Strong National Museum of Play has announced the 12 games nominated in 2024 for the World Video Game Hall of Fame: Asteroids, Elite, Guitar Hero, Metroid, Myst, Neopets, Resident Evil, Tokimeki Memorial, Tony Hawkâs Pro Skater, Ultima, and You Donât Know Jack.
âThe finalists this year have the honor of competing to be in the 10th class of inductees to the World Video Game Hall of Fame,â The Strongâs International Center for the History of Electronic Games director Jon-Paul C. Dyson said in a statement. âEven 10 years in, thereâs no shortage of deserving contenders that have had enormous influence on pop culture or the game industry itself. These games span decades. Asteroids is an icon of the late 70s arcade. Myst showed the potential of CD-ROM technology in the 90s. Neopets became a staple of browser-based, free games as we entered the 2000s. And Guitar Hero, which is less than 20 years old, has already proven its staying power.â
The public will vote for their favorites on the World Video Game Hall of Fame website, and the three top games will be added to a ballot. The other ballots are submitted by the International Selection Advisory Committee, which The Strong Museum said includes âjournalists and scholars familiar with the history of video games and their roles in society.â The public vote is open from March 14 to March 21. The inductees will be announced on May 9 during an in-person ceremony.
Last year, Barbie Fashion Designer, Computer Space, The Last of Us, and Wii Sports were added to the World Video Game Hall of Fame, beating out games like Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, FIFA International Soccer, GoldenEye 007, NBA 2K, Quake, and Wizardry. So far, 44 games have been recognized as part of the World Video Game Hall of Fame.
In a news release, The Strong Museum outlined what makes each game worthy of a spot in the World Video Game Hall of Fame:
Asteroids: Released in 1979, Atariâs Asteroids offered players challenging gameplay, glowing graphics, and intense sound effects in an action-packed space setting. The game quickly supplanted the popular Space Invaders in many arcades and sold more than 70,000 arcade units, becoming Atariâs bestselling coin-operated game. The home version of the gameâmade available on the Atari 2600âtook the gameâs popularity to new heights, bringing it into millions of living rooms. 
Elite: Developed in Great Britain and released in 1984, Elite pioneered innovative 3-D graphics and the idea of open-world games by allowing players to control ships that roamed the galaxy. The expansive universe and strategy elements helped to spawn a generation of games with endless play possibilities, such as Grand Theft Auto 3 and Eve Online. Elite proved to be one of the most popular games of the British personal computer boom in the 1980s, and it dramatically impacted the design of other games. 
Guitar Hero: Launched in 2005, Harmonixâs Guitar Hero challenged players to unleash their inner rock star by following on-screen notes and strumming to the beat of popular music on a plastic guitar. Its wide appeal, licensed music, and social gameplay spawned other similar titles, including the popular Rock Band. Activision, which acquired the gameâs rights, released versions of Guitar Hero for nearly every platform, including home consoles, computers, and handheld and mobile devices. The Guitar Hero series has sold more than 25 million units worldwide and more than 60 million tracks, earning more than $2 billion.
Metroid: Nintendoâs Metroid launched in 1986 and inserted players into a futuristic world brimming with innovative adventure and evocative music. The game combined the platforming of Nintendoâs Super Mario Bros. and non-linear story elements from The Legend of Zelda, offering a new game play experience.  The protagonist, Samus, also gave the gaming industry its first playable human female character in mainstream video games. The game launched a franchise with 13 core titles that has sold more than 20 million units worldwide. 
Myst: Released by Broderbund in 1993, Myst welcomed players to a mesmerizing world of mysterious puzzles and haunting vistas. The game harnessed early CD-ROM technologyâwhich offered high storage capacity but slow loading times. The discs paired well with the slow-paced, contemplative style of the game, though, and allowed the creation of an immersive world. Myst became the best-selling computer game in the 1990s, selling more than six million copies. 
Neopets: When Neopets debuted in 1999, it quickly became a staple of browser-based, free-to-play games. The online world of Neopia allows its players to explore various lands, care for pets, and engage in a robust social component, complete with opportunities to chat with other players and form guilds. Neopets also showcased the potential of the Internet for gaming and served as a testing ground for cyber safety mechanisms and immersive advertising. At its peak in 2005, Neopets had 25 million active users, and it continues to be popular more than two decades later. 
Resident Evil: Although it wasnât the first horror video game, Resident Evil (or Biohazard as it was known in Japan) was the first game to popularize the âsurvival horrorâ genre. Created by game director Shinji Mikami and released by Capcom in 1996, Resident Evil spawned a billion-dollar media franchise while it helped demonstrate that video games could offer mature entertainment for older teenagers and adults. As of 2022, films based on the Resident Evil franchise have collective grossed more than $1.2 billion. 
SimCity: Released by Maxis in 1989, SimCity helped expand the audience for video games by offering a city building simulator that appealed to adults as much as children. Drawing from real-life principles of urban design, it allowed players to build their own city and respond to ever-changing problems. The game spawned numerous sequels and offshootsâsuch as World Video Game Hall of Fame inductee The Simsâand influenced the development of many city-building simulation games and even real-time strategy games, like Command and Conquer and Age of Empires. 
Tokimeki Memorial: Konamiâs Tokimeki Memorial brought a cohesive narrative, colorful graphics, unparalleled depth of choices, and engaging gameplay to the dating simulator genre after its launch in 1994. While it was never localized outside Japan, its impact on game design was widespread, paving the way for graphic adventure games, visual novels, dating sims, and roleplaying games to invest more in personal relationships as part of their gameplay loop.  
Tony Hawkâs Pro Skater: Launched by Neversoft/Activision in 1999, Tony Hawkâs Pro Skater brought the sport and culture of skateboarding into millions of households. Players flew from ramps and jumps, using the environment as a playground to bust out high-point tricks, all with a memorable soundtrack. The legendary Tony Hawk himself said the game âsimultaneously ignited my career and overshadowed it.â Its success led to sequels that have generated approximately $1.4 billion in sales.
Ultima: Ultima: The First Age of Darkness helped define the computer role-playing genre. Designed by Richard Garriott and released in 1981, Ultima combined role-playing mechanics, a massive fictional world, and fantasy and science fiction themes. Ultimaâs innovative gameplay laid the foundation for one of the most enduring and influential gaming franchises of all time (with eight sequels). Many top game designers credit it with inspiring their later role-playing games, such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.  
You Donât Know Jack: The developers of You Donât Know Jack reimagined the television game show format for home video game markets. Debuting in 1995, You Donât Know Jack combined witty questions with humor in a multi-player party game. Sequels and spinoffs continue to find success on Facebook and mobile platforms, and steaming versions were extremely popular in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

New Resident Evil 2 mod recreates the original experience with 1700 cameras,"The Resident Evil franchise has evolved multiple times, much like one of its infamous bosses that you have to blow up with a rocket launcher. For instance, while the new games come with modern camera controls, the original Resident Evil games (or is the plural Residents Evil?) had a fixed angle camera. The tradeoff for the slower and more awkward gameplay was a more deliberate framing of scenes, with each environment carefully set up to build maximum tension.
A new mod by alphaZomega takes the controls and framing of the first Resident Evil 2 (1998), and recreates it using Resident Evil 2 (2017).  Instead of the camera hovering over Leon or Claireâs shoulder, thereâs a series of 1700 fixed cameras put all over the game. When the player walks out of one frame, the point of view switches to another camera. Itâs a novel and nostalgic interpretation of the game, and it looks great in action.
YouTuber Residence of Evil filmed a 15 minute showcase of the game, which shows off the merge between the two takes on Resident Evil 2.
The video shows a gameplay style that is much more claustrophobic and awkward to navigate, but some fans argue that the original systems are much scarier. Luckily, players do have a helping hand with this mod. The developer included the auto-aim from the original game as well, with a laser-pointer that snaps onto different body parts.
With a franchise as long enduring as Resident Evil, itâs natural that there would be different eras that form over time. The original PlayStation games still hold up, all this time later. There are newer and genuinely great games in the Resident Evil archive, but the original vision continues to endure among horror fans.",https://www.polygon.com/24099920/resident-evil-2-remake-mod-fixed-camera,2024-03-13 21:04:42
The next RimWorld expansion adds a hefty dose of Lovecraftian terror,"Iâve fallen in love with sci-fi colony management RimWorld, which is unparalleled at creating wild stories through random gameplay events. RimWorld has a few expansion packs, adding things like royalty, religion, gene-editing, and child rearing to the game. Today, Ludeon Studios announced a new expansion pack is on the way, and itâs going to be the scariest one yet: Anomaly.
Anomalyâs content begins once the colonists âaccidentally provoke a mad superintelligence,â according to the release blog. âFrom then on, madness manifests: Monstrous creatures, mind-bending mysteries, infiltrating parasites, and sanity-shredding phenomena that twist the whole world around you.â
RimWorld is already a fairly horrifying game but less in a supernatural or paranormal way, and more in being a showcase of manâs inhumanity to man. Itâs a game where you can harvest organs and menace your slave population by putting dead bodies in terrifying cages, after all. But Anomaly looks much more focused on providing an external horror threat that your colonists must band together to survive, a la The Thing.
Ludeon shared some tantalizing scenarios that the player may encounter during a playthrough, and Iâm already excited at the possibility of encountering the beautiful cube. I crave cube. The rest of the scenarios are chock full of classic sci-fi and horror inspiration.
At night, hear the screeching of a psychically-invisible hunter that feeds on human souls. Build proximity alarms to detect when itâs near, but you can only fight it when it chooses to reveal itself. Chip away at its health every time it returns, and collect and study chunks of its flesh. Turn the tables, become the hunter and kill it where it lives.
A massive flesh creature is growing across the landscape, consuming and covering the whole map with a quivering mass of meat. It defends itself with beasts and acid. Fight it to get samples of its nervous system, then study them until you can venture to its heart and kill it for good.
A parasite has mind-controlled some of your colonists - but who? They pretend to be human as they work to infest others. Track evidence, imprison, interrogate, and medically test people to find out who is infested before itâs too late.
A pulsating obelisk crash-lands near your base. You can try to suppress its filthy energy, but the obelisk may lash out and violently mutate your people, copy them endlessly, or abduct them to an endless gray maze.
Your colonists become obsessed with a beautiful golden cube, one by one. They build statues of the cube. They worship the cube. They love the cube.
A corpse arrives that looks exactly like one of your colonists - and seems to follow them. No matter what you do, the corpse returnsâ¦
And many more weird and horrifying events!
While Iâm a little sad that my current, heavily modded RimWorld run is coming to an end, Iâm already excited to start a new colony doomed by terrifying obelisks and sneaky mind-controlling parasites. Lareon also teased new monsters â and facilities in which the player can study them. 
Anomaly is due to release alongside update 1.5 âin one month,â according to a tweet from RimWorld creator Tynan Sylvester. ",https://www.polygon.com/24099829/rimworld-anomaly-horror-expansion-announcement,2024-03-13 19:17:24

"âTikTok billâ passes House vote, but is not yet banned","The United States House of Representatives has passed the âTikTok billâ that would effectively ban the short-form video-sharing app if owner ByteDance doesnât divest. Representatives voted on Wednesday on the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, pushing it forward with a majority vote of 352 to 65. The bill is expected to move onto the Senate for another vote if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) brings it to the floor. President Biden said heâd sign the bill should it reach his desk.
Despite the vote, TikTok is not banned in the United States; the app will remain available indefinitely. The bill needs to pass several layers of government processes; Senator Schumer said he will consult with committee chairmen to decide whether to bring it for a vote in the Senate. If it moves into the Senate, it will face another vote where its face is uncertain. If it passes in the Senate, itâll move to President Biden for a signature. That signature doesnât necessarily mean TikTok is banned â the governmentâs goal is to get ByteDance to sell the app to an American owner. If ByteDance doesnât comply, thatâs when distributing TikTok would become illegal.
âIâm voting NO on the TikTok forced sale bill,â Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted to X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday. âThis bill was incredibly rushed, from committee to vote in 4 days, with little explanation. There are serious antitrust and privacy questions here, and any national security concerns should be laid out to the public prior to a vote.â
Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) added that the bill could potentially impact âan infinite number of companies.â In opposition, Rep. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) claimed that ByteDance and TikTok employees are âtaking ordersâ from the Chinese Communist Party. Rep Nancy Pelosi (D-Cal) also urged members to vote yes, while others assured members that the bill will only result in a ban if ByteDance doesnât sell the app.
The bill was proposed by Reps. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party in early March. The bill would prohibit ByteDance apps â like TikTok â on U.S. app stores; TikTok can stay, though, if the app âsevers tiesâ to ByteDance, a Chinese company. Crucially, the bill is not limited to ByteDance and TikTok, though it is the app targeted currently; the bill could impact companies, websites, and apps from countries deemed by the government as âforeign adversaries.â If the bill is signed into law, ByteDance would have 165 days to sell the app. A Wall Street Journal report suggested that ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is looking to purchase TikTok.
The bill would make it illegal to distribute or update said apps and to provide internet hosting to enable distribution and updates. On March 7, the House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously advanced the bill â just two days after it was proposed. Thatâs when it moved into the House, where, under fast-track rules, it needed a two-thirds majority vote to pass.
Lawmakers describe the bill as a way âto protect national security of the United States from the threat posed by foreign adversary controlled applications.â The FBI and the Federal Communications Commission believe that TikTok owner ByteDance may share TikTok user data with the Chinese government; this speculation is due to a Chinese law that requires companies to provide the government with user data should there be a risk to Chinese national security, the Associated Press reported last year, despite little evidence TikTok has done so. Concern over ByteDanceâs reach into U.S. user data has been around for years, but was reunited once again after the company admitted it had fired four employees who collected user data on several journalists. 
TikTok itself has been sending push notifications to U.S.-based users, asking them to contact government representatives to prevent a âtotal ban of TikTok,â according to The Verge. The message has a slot for users to enter their zip code and easily call a representative. A Politico report from Monday suggested thousands of TikTok users have âbombardedâ House lawmakers. The effort appears to have failed to sway the House, given the vote Wednesday. TikTok chief executive officer Shou Chew, who testified on behalf of the app to Congress in March 2023, was in Washington, D.C. Tuesday to lobby Senators against the bill. The FBI, the Justice Department, and the Office of the Directors of National Intelligence were also on Capitol Hill Tuesday to brief House members on TikTok, Bloomberg reported.
A separate bipartisan bill, known as the RESTRICT Act, was proposed last year; the legislation never gained enough support to move to a vote, but it spurred Chewâs testimony in Congress. Former President Trump called for a TikTok ban in 2020, but ahead of the vote, changed his tune: Now, Trump opposes the ban because doing so would make Facebook â which he called âan enemy of the peopleâ in a CNBC interview â more powerful. TikTok has since been banned from use by government workers on their work devices; thereâs both a federal ban and bans in several local governments. The state of Montana recently banned TikTok as well, but the decision was later blocked by a judge. 
The American Civil Liberties Union lobbied against previous bills that would ban TikTok, and has rallied again in advance of the new vote. In a statement from March 5, the ACLU said a TikTok ban âwould have profound implications for our constitutional right to free speech and free expression because millions of Americans rely on the app every day for information, communication, advocacy, and entertainment.â 
With a two-third majority vote in the House, the bill will now move onto the Senate. Its reception is not nearly as straightforward there; Republican and Democratic senators have expressed concerns over the precision of the bill, which specifically names ByteDance and TikTok. âYou donât want to establish a precedent on naming an individual company,â Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) said Tuesday, according to Axios.
Update: This story has been updated to include more details on the billâs path forward.",https://www.polygon.com/24099435/tiktok-ban-bill-passes-house-vote-march-2024,2024-03-13 15:20:20
"Critical Roleâs new Daggerheart characters are frog, turtle, and insect people","The cast of Critical Role marks its ninth anniversary this week, and to celebrate theyâve launched the beta version of Daggerheart, a wholly new role-playing game to be published by their Darrington Press imprint. Itâs a Dungeons & Dragons competitor that has been in development for a few years now and the beta version is massive, with a draft manuscript alone clocking in at nearly 380 pages. Thankfully, the eight-person cast is here to make it a whole lot simpler â and more fun â with a raucous session of character generation.
Lead by game master Matt Mercer, all seven of the core members of Critical Role showed up last night for a Daggerheart session zero â that is, the character generation and table-setting that proceeds the opening round of play. That gave them the opportunity to show off some of the things in this new game that make it so unique. They even mixed things up a bit by taking on classes and ancestries that go against their usual type.

Hereâs where they landed on the first go-around:
After character generation, the gang dove right into the one-shot itself, which you can currently find behind the paywall on their Twitch channel. The Daggerheart playtest continues for some time, with access available on the Darrington Press website and on DriveThruRPG.

RuneScape creator reveals new MMO 10 years in the making,"Sometimes a game makes you feel soothed just by looking at a screenshot, even if itâs not that pretty. So it is with Brighter Shores, the new project from Andrew Gower, creator of hoary old massively multiplayer role-playing game RuneScape.
Along with his brother Paul, Gower did most of the early development work on RuneScape (which launched in 2001) and founded the studio that made it, Jagex. The Gowers cashed out and left Jagex back in 2010, and little has been heard of what Andrew has been up to since. Now we know: Heâs spent much of that time â 10 years, apparently â making another old-school MMO with a comfortingly nerdy grid-based design. (The press release justifiably calls these orderly isometric dioramas Gowerâs âinstantly recognisable style.â)
Brighter Shores will be a free-to-play game with a âcozy, relaxing atmosphere.â Itâs set in and around a peaceful coastal town in the fantasy land of Adothria. Thereâs a heavy focus on crafting, as well as three new character classes to try: Cryoknight, Hammermage, and Guardian. Gower says he aims to reduce the grind typical of this kind of game, and his studio Fen Research plans to offer an âall-inclusiveâ premium pass unlocking additional content rather than a lot of microtransactions.
After all this time, Gower has also finally left Java behind. RuneScape was launched as a browser game written in this humble programming language, and didnât transition to its own client until 2016, after the Gowers had left. But Fen Research has built its own custom engine and programming language for Brighter Shores, called Fenforge. (Geographical trivia: both studio and engine are likely named after the Fens, a marshy flatland area in the east of England that extends north of Cambridge, where both Jagex and Fen Research are based.)
Brighter Shores will be coming to PC and Mac via Steam later this year.",https://www.polygon.com/24099403/runescape-andrew-gower-brighter-shores-new-mmo,2024-03-13 15:00:00
J Loâs new movie looks Titanfall AF,"Jennifer Lopezâs upcoming Netflix movie casts her as a âbrilliant but misanthropic data analyst with a deep distrust of artificial intelligenceâ in the sci-fi action flick Atlas. But the first teaser for Atlas doesnât really get into that relationship with AI or the renegade robot with whom Lopezâs character âshares a mysterious past.â What the teaser does do is raise one question: Who on the production of this movie played a ton of Titanfall?
Atlas may not have official ties to Respawn Entertainmentâs beloved mech shooter, but the vibes are certainly there. The filmâs first look promises orbital mech drops and mech-on-mech action, and its official description hints at an emotional connection to a robot. Thatâs as close as weâll probably ever get to a cinematic adaptation of the Titanfall games.
Oh, also, Lopezâs character is named Atlas Shepherd, which I can only assume was concocted by someone who played a lot of Xbox 360 games in 2007. Atlas was written by Leo Sardarian and Aron Eli Coleite (who had previously written for Star Trek: Discovery and Heroes), and directed by Brad Peyton (San Andreas, Rampage), an avowed fan of the game Lost Planet.
Joining Lopez in Atlas are Simu Liu (Barbie, Shang-Chi), Oscar nominee Sterling K. Brown (American Fiction, Black Panther), Lana Parrilla (Once Upon a Time), and Mark Strong (Kingsman: The Secret Service).
Atlas drops on Netflix on May 24.",https://www.polygon.com/24099465/netflix-atlas-jennifer-lopez-scifi-movie,2024-03-13 14:31:36
"Scream brings back Neve Campbell as franchise returns to the drawing board, again","Scream is a franchise in free fall. After two successful quasi-reboot sequels, and a plan to seemingly move away from the seriesâ roots, it seems that Spyglass Media is bringing Neve Campbell back to Scream. The actor announced her return to the series on Tuesday, but didnât provide any further details on what the story of Scream 7 would be.
After an incredibly successful 2022 retooling, which brought in new franchise stars like Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, the franchise has suffered one misstep after another. The trouble started in 2023, with the release of Scream VI, which while still a fairly substantial hit at the box office, got slightly more tepid reception than the previous entry. 
For many fans, one of the most disappointing elements of the movie was the sidelining of seriesâ protagonist Sidney Prescott (Campbell), who had been in every previous film. This time around, the seriesâ other regular, Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), was forced to simply handwave Sidneyâs absence in a throwaway line of dialogue. As it turns out, however, Campbell refused to do the movie because she felt that the studioâs salary offer was too low, given her importance and history with the franchise. 
Despite fans missing Sidney, when Spyglass Media announced plans for Scream 7, which would bring back the main characters from the last two movies, expectations and excitement were still high â not least of all because the fabulous Christopher Landon (Happy Death Day) was being brought on to direct the new entry. 
However, shortly into production, Spyglass unceremoniously fired Barrera, the star of the previous two movies, over her posts about the Israel-Gaza conflict, which the studio deemed antisemitic. Shortly after, Ortega left the project as well. While scheduling differences were the only reason given, it seems very odd that the movie wouldnât reschedule to accommodate one of the biggest stars in the world. Finally, Landon left shortly after Barreraâs firing, leaving the project with no stars and no director. At least until now. 
Campbell announced her return to the series on Instagram on Tuesday, and the writer and creator of the original movie, Kevin Williams, has announced that heâll be directing the new entry. Guy Busick, who co-wrote the previous two movies, will handle the writing on Scream 7. While so much of this feels like a franchise reboot, with two of the original key players returning to the franchise, itâs highly unclear what this new movie might be about. On top of that, thereâs no word which members of the cast from the previous movie might return.

X-Men â97âs showrunner has been fired a week before its premiere,"As a rule, things are never easy for the X-Men â something that seems to apply in real life as well as comic books. In a shocking update from The Hollywood Reporter, Beau DeMayo, creator and showrunner of the highly-anticipated X-Men â97 animated series on Disney Plus, has been fired a week before the showâs March 20 premiere. 
According to THR, DeMayo, who had just finished scripting season 2 of X-Men â97, was suddenly fired last week, and will no longer participate in the showâs promotion. No reason was given for the termination from either Marvel nor DeMayoâs representatives. Polygon has reached out to Disney for comment, but has not received anything at time of publication. 
X-Men â97 is the biggest release on the Disney Plus calendar this month, a continuation of the Fox Kids runaway hit X-Men: The Animated Series that picked up right where the old show left off after its 76-episode run concluded in September 1997. Despite numerous delays, the series has already been renewed for a second season â and, prior to DeMayoâs firing, a third was reportedly being contemplated. 
X-Men â97 is currently scheduled to premiere its 10-episode first season on Disney Plus March 20.",https://www.polygon.com/24098834/x-men-97-creator-fired-why,2024-03-12 19:42:47
Overwatch 2âs Cowboy Bebop crossover is now live,"Overwatch 2âs second anime crossover event will bring the characters (and music) of Cowboy Bebop to the team-based hero shooter on March 12, Blizzard Entertainment announced Thursday. The collab will add new Cowboy Bebop-inspired skins, emotes, highlight intros, and more to Overwatch 2, including an Ein skin for Wrecking Ball that all players will be able to unlock for free.
The other confirmed characters getting Cowboy Bebop-inspired looks include Cassidy as Spike Spiegel, Ashe as Faye Valentine (with a Red Tail-inspired BOB), Sombra as Ed, and Mauga as Jet Black. Blizzard and anime studio Sunrise originally revealed stylized artwork of those characters, and later revealed the in-game versions of the five heroes reimagined as Cowboy Bebop characters.
In a new gameplay trailer released Monday, we even get to hear some of the collabâs new voice lines, including Ashe delivering the familiar âSee you, space cowboyâ line.
âWeâre honored to be collaborating with one of the most respected anime series of all time in Cowboy Bebop,â Overwatch 2 associate director Aimee Dennett said in a statement. âThis collaboration is a wonderful way to pay homage to the legendary stories, art, animation, and music of the Cowboy Bebop series. We hope its fans and our players have as much fun with what weâre bringing to Overwatch 2 as we did in creating it.â
Overwatch 2âs first anime collab was with One Punch Man, and brought characters like Saitama, Genos, Terrible Tornado, and Mumen Rider to the world of Overwatch. That crossover event ran for about a month in-game, and required players to complete challenges to unlock free cosmetics.
You can get a sneak preview of the Cowboy Bebop Overwatch 2 skins in the gallery below. Cowboy Bebop is currently streaming on Crunchyroll in select territories.
Pricing for Overwatch 2âs Cowboy Bebop cosmetics is now live. Hereâs what the whole collab costs:
Individual Legendary skins cost 1,900 Overwatch Coins each.
Overwatch 2 is available to play for free on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.",https://www.polygon.com/24092249/overwatch-2-cowboy-bebop-skins-release-date,2024-03-12 18:00:00
"Zweihander, the RPG engine behind Flames of Freedom, has risen from the dead","Zweihander: Grim and Perilous RPG, the original tabletop system at the core of groundbreaking titles like Flames of Freedom and Blackbirds, is back on the market. A new crowdfunding campaign for the gameâs second iteration, dubbed Zweihander Reforged Edition, launches today. Polygon sat down with creator Daniel D. Fox to learn more â including how things almost went completely off the rails back in 2022.
Itâs not often that a new tabletop role-playing game can muscle past the Dungeons & Dragons of the world, but thatâs just what happened for Zweihander. After taking home the gold Ennie award for best game in 2018, the Kansas City author and designer parlayed his win into a role at Andrews McMeel Universal as the director of the companyâs fledgling games division. Then, just a few years later, everything â including his role with the company â fell apart. The reason? Fox tells Polygon it had a lot to do with the price of paper at the time.
âEven though we were exceeding our projections on revenues,â Fox said, âthis is a 30-person company with a new [line of] business. Theyâre great at what they do. Theyâre not great at new business. So I had a long discussion with the president of publishing, and he [decided we should] wind this down.â
The news came at an inopportune time on the tail end of the pandemic, just as interest in non-D&D tabletop RPGs began to accelerate. It also torpedoed, for a time, the production of another high-profile crowdfunding success, Into the Mother Lands. And while that project quickly found a new home with Green Ronin, Zweihander itself continued to hover on the brink. That is, until Fox met up with the team at World of Game Design.
âZweihander falls beneath the World of Game design umbrella,â Fox said, âso they are the owner and the publisher.â
Fox still has plenty of creative control, however. Together with collaborators Kate Bullock and Anna Goldberg, Fox is in the process of putting the finishing touches on the revised game â work that heâs been forced to sideline for far too long.
âWe had all this community feedback, from all of these playtesters,â Fox said. âWe kind of collected all this information over the last six, seven years, from people who had been playing Zweihander, and there are a lot of things that we wanted to change, too.â 
In addition to revised and more colorful art, Fox said that much of the gameâs flavor text is also being rewritten for modern audiences. The game also takes an even more aggressive stance on character death. 
âWhatâs interesting about Zweihander is most RPGs really focus on the kind of zero-to-hero momentum,â Fox said. âSo D&D, Pathfinder, those are great games. I play them. I love them. But [...] what if it wasnât zero-to-hero and zero-to-one? What if you played flawed, tragic characters who werenât trying to change the world, but the world was trying to change them? And then what would that journey look like for that character â or in this case, we call them survivors. What would that journey look like for the survivor if they were kind of fighting against these evils and these things that are trying to turn them almost into the monsters they were fighting themselves?â
You can learn more about Zweihander Reforged Edition at the campaign page, which includes a link to a free âsession zeroâ quickstart document. The campaign runs now through April 7, with delivery expected by Feb. 2025.",https://www.polygon.com/24098495/zweihander-rpg-kickstarter-campaign-announcement,2024-03-12 16:29:44
"Warner holds on to Studio Ghibli movies, thanks to multiyear Max streaming deal","Hereâs a minor win for fans of Good Things who also subscribe to Max: the Studio Ghibli collection will remain on streaming for the foreseeable future. 
Over the last year, media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery has become the emblem of cutthroat restructuring in an already tumultuous entertainment landscape. Under CEO David Zaslav, the company has buried Warner Bros. movies like Batgirl and Coyote vs. Acme for tax purposes, licensed classic HBO content to Netflix, partnered with Disney and Fox to create a sports streaming service, gutted (then reconsidered) Turner Classic Movies, delisted indie games on Steam as it openly pivots its gaming division to a free-to-play strategy, and put all its chips on James Gunn to save the DC movie and TV properties. The decisions ruffled artistsâ feathers and sent a fog over the brandâs many studios, the future left frustratingly unclear.
But someone upstairs really loves Hayao Miyazakiâs films. Theyâve been deemed important enough to lock down on the Max service.
Max and GKIDS, one of the great animation distributors operating today, announced on Tuesday that the 2020 deal that brought the Studio Ghibli library to streaming for the first time â including all of master Hayao Miyazakiâs films â has been reupped in a âmultiyear agreement.â (A representative for Max declined to share specifics around the deal with Polygon.) Films like My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, Kikiâs Delivery Service, and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya were all part of the original, unprecedented deal four years ago, which saw the collection come to streaming for the first time alongside the launch of the HBO Max service. Time has passed, mergers have occurred, and rebranding efforts have morphed HBO Max into just Max, but the good news is that the Ghibli movies remain â and will stay in streaming circulation at least until 2025.
The announcement also notes that Miyazakiâs Oscar-winning film The Boy and the Heron is included in the deal, and will premiere on Max âlater this year.â Positioned as Miyazakiâs final film, The Boy and the Heron won big at the 96th Academy Awards earlier this month, though the director was not on hand to receive the award. His longtime producer and Ghibli cofoudner Toshio Suzuki later issued this statement, delivered via a translator backstage at the Oscars, in response to the win.  
âThis was a truly difficult project to bring to completion,â he wrote. âI am very appreciative that the work that was created after overcoming these difficulties has been received by so many people around the world and has received this recognition. Both Hayao Miyazaki and I have aged considerably. I am grateful to receive such an honor at my age. And taking this as a message to continue our work, I will devote myself to work harder in the future. Thank you very much.â

Star Wars Jedi director starts new studio with a bunch of ex-Respawn talent,"Game director Stig Asmussen, who left Respawn Entertainment last fall after making two games for publisher Electronic Arts, has a new studio. Itâs called Giant Skull, and heâs bringing a long list of ex-Respawn talent with him to his new venture.
Asmussenâs credits include Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, its sequel, and multiple God of War games. So it should be no surprise then that his new company is described as âdedicated to building gameplay-driven, story immersed action-adventure games set in captivating worlds.â Giant Skullâs first untitled project is a âAAA single-player-focused action-adventure,â built in Unreal Engine 5, the developer said in a news release announcing the studio.
Joining Asmussen at Giant Skull are other veteran game developers from Epic Games, Riot Games, and Rocksteady Studios, including: Jon Carr, technical director on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor; Patrick Murphy, an art director who worked on Fortnite, Valorant, League of Legends, and God of War; Lauren McLemore, a lead producer on Fortnite; Jeff Magers, design director on the Star Wars Jedi games; and Brian Campbell, formerly animation director at Epic Games.
âWe have assembled a talented team renowned for immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal, and our goal is to craft a rich universe that players will want to lose themselves in for years to come,â Asmussen said in a statement.
âWe want players to join us on every step of this amazing journey, as we pave the way for our upcoming game,â said Anthony Scott, COO/CFO of Giant Skull, and formerly director of operations at Rocksteady Studios and head of Unbroken Studios. âWeâre creating something special and have been fortunate enough to assemble an incredible initial team of developers who are extremely passionate and experienced in creating genre-defining, third person action-adventures.â
Giant Skullâs announcement comes just a few weeks after mass layoffs at publisher Electronic Arts, which also canceled Respawnâs in-development first-person shooter set in the Star Wars universe. Asmussenâs new studio also comes amid severe cutbacks at studios and publishers across North America and Europe; thousands of video game workers have lost their jobs this year, following a similarly dour year for employment in the industry.

New Helldivers 2 patch means changing the way you take on super-armored Terminids,"If youâre one of the Helldivers 2 players whoâve been struggling to take on the gameâs powerful Terminids â specifically, Chargers and Bile Titans â youâre in luck. Arrowhead Game Studios published a patch on Tuesday that tweaks the spawn rates of those two bugs. Crucially, Arrowhead said it hasnât changed the overall difficulty: There will be fewer of these heavily armored enemies, but other bugs will show up âin greater numbers,â according to the patch notes.
Helldivers 2 players have been strategizing online how to take on Chargers (the massive Terminids that may as well be tanks) and Bile Titans (which are the supercharged, leggy versions of the Bile Spewers). The jump in difficulty from other enemies to these is pretty significant, and people have struggled to take them down reliably. Players have found ways to take on the enemies â i.e. the âlega meta,â where people target a weak spot in the legs â but Arrowhead doesnât want players to have to use their âheavy anti-tank weapons on legs instead of the obvious weak point.â Thatâs why, in addition to reducing the spawn rate of Chargers and Bile Titans on difficulty 7 and up, Arrowhead has lowered the health of the Chargerâs head, making it a good place to target with powerful weapons.

âTogether with the unfortunately undocumented change of last patch that increased the armor penetration ability of less well placed shots for EAT-17s and Recoilless Rifle shots, Chargers should now be easier to handle by well equipped groups,â Arrowhead said.
Alongside the Terminid tweaks, Helldivers 2 players can expect a couple of UI, voiceover, and bug fixes, too. Arrowhead has also removed the âElectronic Countermeasuresâ operation modifier. (Technically, it was removed in the last patch, but Arrowhead didnât mention it in the patch notes.) The studio is looking to rework the modifier: âWe found that this modifier wasnât communicated clearly enough and overall caused more frustration than excitement with the way it was currently implemented,â Arrowhead said.
Arrowhead ended its patch notes with a list of known issues in Helldivers 2, including an issue that causes the game to crash when using a stim inside an Exosuit. Hereâs the full list, straight from Arrowhead:

The Ghostbusters are coming to Destiny 2 ahead of the new movie,"Bungieâs latest Destiny 2 pop culture crossover is nearly here. But this time it isnât skins or armor sets from another video game, itâs items from an upcoming movie â Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, to be precise.
On Monday, Bungie revealed on X, formerly Twitter, that three Ghostbusters-themed cosmetics are coming to Destiny 2. Thereâs a Guardian ship based on the infamous Ecto-1 car, a Ghost shell based on the franchisesâ most recognizable ghost, Slimer, and a Sparrow that seems to take inspiration from the main villain of Frozen Empire. All of these cosmetics are coming to Destiny 2 on March 19, just three days before Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire hits theaters.
As for the cost of these items, Bungie hasnât revealed anything yet. However, going off of previous bundles, it seems likely this pack will cost anywhere from 2200 Silver (about $20) to 2800 Silver (about $30). Previous packs that include a Sparrow, ship, and Ghost shell only run 2200 Silver (often reduced to only 1900 during sales), but last yearâs pack based on The Witcher franchise ran for 2800 (2500 on sale).
This is the latest in a long line of cosmetic crossovers for Bungie and Destiny 2. It all started with Fortnite back in 2022. Since then Bungie has added PlayStation mascots like Kratos from God of War to the game, and even items inspired by Assassinâs Creed and The Witcher. Most recently, Guardians were able to pick up armor based on the Mass Effect franchise, which also came with a free ship, Sparrow, and Ghost. 
The Ghostbusters crossover does seem a bit different than the other crossovers. First, it isnât drawing primary inspiration from another game â although The Witcher obviously also has a popular Netflix show. Second, there are no Ghostbuster armor sets for players to purchase and wear. As far as Bungie has revealed, this Ghostbusters collaboration only includes the two vehicles and the Ghost. So any Guardians hoping to suit up with their own Proton Pack or Venkman jumpsuit appear to be out of luck.",https://www.polygon.com/24097368/ghostbusters-destiny-cosmetics-frozen-empire,2024-03-11 18:58:20
Lego unveils three big Super Mario sets coming in August,"Lego has three new Super Mario sets launching on Aug. 1, and it teased Mario Kart sets coming in 2025. While it only showed a silhouette of Marioâs signature kart, itâs pretty exciting nevertheless. As for 2024 releases, Lego dropped a bunch of details on new sets as part of Nintendoâs annual Mario Day celebration. With every release, it seems like the possibility for antics multiplies. Case in point: Roy, King Boo, and Bowser star in these upcoming sets.
The Bowser Express Train set (shown above) is a big 1,392-piece set thatâll be on sale for $119.99. It comes with everything needed to stage an assault on the Mushroom Kingdom, including a cannon, a Hammer Bro, and an fiendish look thatâs sure to make any nearby Toads and Toadettes run in circles (Toads and Toadettes not included). Unrelated to the assault, it serves as transportation for some very dignified Goombas who simply wish to go from place to place in style. 
All that the King Booâs Haunted Mansion set needs to turn into a Luigiâs Mansion simulator is a Luigi figure from his starter course. This 932-piece set costs $74.99, and includes his majesty, King Boo, a smaller, more bashful Boo, along with Dry Bones and a yellow baby Yoshi. As with other expansion sets, youâll need one of the original Mario, Luigi, or Peach starter set figures to fully experience this one. The figures included in those can scan the barcode-like objects that allow them to collect coins, stars, or perform an action. Alternatively, you can just use your imagination.
Lastly, we have Battle with Roy at Peachâs Castle, a 738-piece set that costs $64.99. Itâs a stunning replica of Peachâs Castle, as depicted in Super Mario 64. Unfortunately, Roy, one of Bowserâs underling Koopas, has arrived to stir up trouble. Toad doesnât look particularly fazed, perhaps knowing that, with a Mario, Luigi, or Peach figure there, things shouldnât get too out of hand.
As mentioned before, buying a starter course is the best way to experience these upcoming expansions. The starter courses are the only way to get your hands on the Mario, Peach, or Luigi figures that possess barcode readers on their feet that help expansion courses come to life. You can use them to collect coins, unlock boxes, stomp on enemies, and ultimately âwinâ at each course. To configure them, youâll need to use the Lego Super Mario mobile app.
Thankfully, for a limited time, many Super Mario courses (including starter courses) are discounted for Mario Day. Hereâs the full selection at Amazon.

"MultiVersus returns in May, nearly a year after going offline","Fighting game MultiVersus, the Smash Bros.-like that merged the worlds of DC Comics, Game of Thrones, Looney Tunes, and other Warner Bros.-owned properties, will relaunch on May 28, developer Player First Games announced Monday. MultiVersus has been offline since June 2023, when the developer took the game down to retool it.
Tony Huynh, co-founder and CEO of Player First, said in a video announcement that MultiVersus has been rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5, which will give the platform fighter a new and improved look. The team has also ârebuilt the game from the ground up to support our new netcode,â Huynh said, and that players can expect âpinpoint accuracyâ and âconsistent game performance, no matter what platform youâre playing on.â
Player First is also âadding some really exciting, brand-new personalities to the roster,â Huynh said, but did not provide specifics on which Warner Bros.-owned characters will come to MultiVersus later this year.
The studio is also adding a brand-new PvE mode, which Huynh says will give players unique rewards.
MultiVersus launched in July 2022, in what Warner Bros. and developer Player First Games called an âopen beta.â In March 2023, the studio announced it was pulling the game from digital stores and taking it offline. At the time, it was the first official update that the studio had provided since November 2022, when Player First brought Marvin the Martian and season 2 content to the game. In the following months, players expressed discontent at the cadence of new characters and other additions.
Over the past eight months, MultiVersus players have only had access to the gameâs offline modes: the training room (aka The Lab) and local matches. The studio promised MultiVersus would return, however, as it developed new characters, maps, and modes, as well as updated netcode and matchmaking improvements.
MultiVersus will become available again for the platforms it was previously released for: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

Thereâll be some kind of new Super Mario Bros. movie in 2026,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie will be getting a sequel... of some sort. Nintendo and animation studio Illumination have announced that theyâre re-teaming on a second film âbased on the world of Super Mario Bros.â to be released on April 3, 2026.
In a note shared on X by the official Nintendo account, Mario creator (and now, movie producer) Shigeru Miyamoto said of the new movie, âWeâre thinking about broadening Marioâs world further, and itâll have a bright and fun story.â
The wording suggests that the film might expand beyond the first movieâs focus on Mario and Luigi and perhaps bring other characters to the fore, but for now, thereâs little to go on. Little, that is, apart from The Super Mario Bros. Movieâs post-credits scene, which strongly suggested Yoshi would play a big part in the sequel.
In other ways, Nintendo, Illumination, and distributor Universal Pictures arenât messing with the formula that brought in over $1.3 billion at the worldwide box office in 2023, making The Super Mario Bros. Movie the second biggest release of the year after Barbie. The core creative team behind the new movie will be exactly the same: directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic and screenwriter Matthew Fogel. The release strategy is a match, too: The Super Mario Bros. Movie also came out in early April (on April 5, 2023, to be exact).
Thereâs no word on casting yet, although it would be surprising if Chris Pratt didnât return to the role of Mario (assuming Mario is actually in this one).
In a video shared to celebrate March 10 (âMAR10 dayâ), Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri said that the companyâs Paris studio was deep into storyboarding and set-building work on the movie, and would begin animation soon.
Before then, though, the studio has Despicable Me 4 â the sixth film starring its world-conquering Minions â coming on on July 4.",https://www.polygon.com/24097038/super-mario-bros-movie-2-2026-nintendo-illumination,2024-03-11 12:31:12
The biggest moments from the 2024 Oscars ,"The Oscars is one of the biggest â if not the biggest â nights in the American entertainment industry every year, and the 2024 Oscars were no different. All the stars were out tonight, from Best Actor nominees like Jeffrey Wright, Paul Giamatti, and Cillian Murphy to Best Director nominees like Christopher Nolan, Martin Scorsese, and Jonathan Glazer.
The night always kicks off before the event officially starts, with some absolutely killer red carpet moments (and this year, a very good dog made a special appearance). Best Supporting Actress DaâVine Joy Randolph and The Zone of Interest director Jonathan Glazer gave some powerful speeches. Billie Eilish and Ryan Gosling brought the Barbie soundtrack to life. The Boy and the Heron beat out some worthy competitors for Best Animated Feature.
Oh, also John Cena got naked! 
In case you missed the three-hour-long broadcast â or you just want to relive some of the best moments â here are the biggest moments from the 2024 Academy Awards. 
No need to worryâMessi, good boy and star of âAnatomy of a Fall,â has arrived at the #Oscars. : https://t.co/sLzfVpOVJj pic.twitter.com/CSo5dTd7Jy
The Oscars is all about deciding who is the yearâs best actor, actress, and director, but one question thatâs somehow eluded the Academy until this year: Whoâs a good boy? Or rather, who is the yearâs goodest boy? Messi the dog from Anatomy of a Fall, thatâs who! There was a bit of uncertainty if everyoneâs favorite pooch was coming to this yearâs ceremony, but luckily, Messi was able to clear his busy schedule to make an appearance at Hollywoodâs biggest night.
Itâs expected that if youâre walking the red carpet for the Oscars, you need to show up in your most eye-popping formal attire. Nimona star and former Try Guy Eugene Lee Yang showed up tonight intent to take home the honor for this yearâs most attention-grabbing ensemble: An elegant red suit jacket complimented with a long flowing dress bottom. 
DaâVine Joy Randolph gave a moving speech while accepting the award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Alexander Payneâs The Holdovers. Co-star Paul Giamatti, who walked DaâVine up to the stage when her name was announced, shed visible tears as Randolph talked about the power of being seen, accepted, and celebrated for her worth and thanking her mother, teachers, and publicists for guiding and supporting her in her career.
While this yearâs Best Animated Feature category was stacked with terrific nominees, Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse and Hayao Miyazakiâs The Boy and the Heron were the films most favored to win the prestigious award. After months of anticipation, The Boy and the Heron was finally revealed to be this yearâs winner for Best Animated Feature. 
His first feature-length animated film in over a decade, The Boy and the Heron marks Miyazakiâs second time winning the award for Best Animated Feature after his landmark win for 2001âs Spirited Away.
Cord Jefferson accepted the award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work on American Fiction. In his speech, Jefferson took a moment to call out Hollywood studios to take more chances on original films like American Fiction. âI understand this is a risk-averse industry,â Jefferson said. âBut instead of making one $200 million movies, try making ten $20 million movies. The next Scorsese is out there, the next Nolan is out there; they just want a shot.â
Billie Eilish took the stage with her brother and collaborator Finneas OâConnell for a stirring orchestral rendition of her song âWhat Was I Made For?â from the Barbie soundtrack. The song is nominated for this yearâs Best Original Song alongside fellow Barbie track âIâm Just Ken.â

Jonathan Glazer accepts the Best International Feature Oscar for The Zone Of Interest: âAll our choices were made to reflect and confront us in the present.

Jonathan Glazer took time in his acceptance speech for Best International Feature on behalf of The Zone of Interest to call out the historical parallels between the events of the Holocaust drama and the ongoing humanitarian crisis of the Israeli-Palestine conflict. âAll our choices were made to reflect and confront us in the present,â Glazer said. âOur film shows where dehumanization leads at its worst.â
In a career first, Robert Downey Jr. won the award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolanâs Oppenheimer.  âIâd like to thank my terrible childhood, and the Academy, in that order,â Downey said. âIâd like to thank my veterinarian â I meant, wife, Susan Downey. She found me a snarling rescue pet, and loved me back to life.â

âBatman, that son of a bitch.â 
With plastic Godzilla toys in hand, the visual effects team for Godzilla Minus One and Director Takashi Yamazaki took to the Oscars stage to accept this yearâs award for Best Visual Effects. In a moving speech, Yamazaki compared his team to the underdog efforts of Rocky Balboa â beating the odds to prove that no matter what, everyone has a chance.
Director Mstyslav Chernov accepts the Best Documentary Feature Oscar for 20 Days In Mariupol: âThis is the first Oscar in Ukrainian history. And Iâm honoured.

20 Days in Mariupol director Mstyslav Chernov took to the stage to accept the award for this yearâs best Documentary Feature. In his acceptance speech, Chernov called attention to the auspiciousness of the Oscar win â the first in Ukrainian history â and expressed his sincerest wish that the history of the Russian-Ukrainian war is told and remembered truthfully. 
âIâll be the first director on this stage who will say, âI wish I never made this filmâ,â Chernov said. âI wish I could exchange this for Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities. I cannot change the history, I cannot change the past. But all together â among you, some of the most talented people in the world â we can make sure the record is set straight, and the truth will prevail. And that the people of Mariupol and those who have given their lives will never be forgotten. Cinema forms memories, and memories form history.â

After extolling some great lines of cinema (including âHe was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she diedâ), John Mulaney went into a rapid-fire SparkNotes rundown of the plot of Field of Dreams, using the phrase âghost baseballâ several times more than any Oscar ceremony on record. 
In a sparkly pink suit, Ryan Gosling started to croon Kenâs big anthem from the audience, before he took the the stage with a group of fellow Kens. It was bright and pink, with big Barbie face props and some karate chops. Also, Slash from Guns Nâ Roses!

Billie Eilish and Finneas accepted the Oscar for Best Original Song for âWhat Was I Made For?â In an emotional speech, Eilish thanked director Margot Robbie and everyone who was deeply affected by Barbie and the song. With this win, Billie Eilish became the first woman to win the âTriple Crownâ (Oscar, Grammy, and Golden Globe) for a work of film music twice.
Christopher Nolan took home the award for Best Director on behalf of Oppenheimer. In his acceptance speech, Nolan thanked his wife and producer Emma Thomas, and commented on how honored he felt to be considered a part of cinemaâs century-long legacy. âWe donât know where this incredible journey is going from here, but to know that you think Iâm a meaningful part of it means the world to me.â Then, they played him off to Hans Zimmerâs Pirates of the Caribbean theme. Weird!
For her role as Bella Baxter in Poor Things, Emma Stone won the award for Best Actress, tearfully accepting the award (and pointing out to the presenters that her dress broke, probably some time during the âIâm Just Kenâ performance). Stone looked incredibly surprised to accept the award, especially when up against Lily Gladstone and Sandra HÃ¼ller.
âItâs not about me,â Stone said, referring to what Poor Things director Yorgos Lanthimos advised her about a possible acceptance speech. âItâs about a team that came together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. That is the best part of making movies.â
Al Pacino presented the award for Best Picture, announcing Oppenheimerâs win in a trail of syllables that everyone in the audience was able to make out just well enough for the winners to take the stage. Producer Emma Thomas Nolan gave the acceptance speech, thanking the Academy, her children, and her husband Christopher Nolan. âThe reason this movie is the movie it was, was Chris Nolan. Heâs singular, heâs brilliantâ¦ and Iâm so grateful for you.â",https://www.polygon.com/24096703/oscar-2024-best-winner-speeches-songs-moments,2024-03-11 02:31:04
Christopher Nolan finally won an Oscar,"The Dark Knight was absolutely snubbed for a Best Picture nomination back in 2009, but oh well, at least the Academy Awards wised up on Christopher Nolan. On Sunday night, the purveyor of big-screen entertainment finally won his Oscar for directing the hell out of Oppenheimer. The biopic, which picked up awards throughout the night, was well-positioned going into the ceremony while Nolanâs directing win was anticipated by fans and awards prognosticators alike. After all, the win was a long time coming for the director who has gone surprisingly overlooked by the industryâs biggest awards show.
Nolanâs win comes off a past that includes a scant number of nominations and zero previous wins. The filmmaker was first nominated alongside his brother â and future Fallout TV director â Jonathan Nolan for their work on Memento. The duo lost to Julian Fellows for Gosford Park. 
Hollywood was abuzz in 2008 under the assumption that The Dark Knight would not only earn the director an accolade but break into the Best Picture top five, shattering a belief that superhero stories had no place in the prestigious annals of Oscar history. But it didnât happen. The Oscars would immediately remake itself in order to never whiff that hard again. 
2011âs Inception put Nolan back in the awards conversation, landing him nominations for Best Screenplay and Picture. But still, no love for direction. The man crashed a train through a city street â what more did these people want?! The answer was war movies; Nolanâs lean, mean WWII thriller Dunkirk scored him a spot at the directorâs table, alongside, Guillermo del Toro (The Shape of Water), Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird), Jordan Peele (Get Out), and Paul Thomas Anderson (Phantom Thread). Del Toro took home the prize, but Nolanâs time would come just a few years later.
âMovies are just over 100 years old,â he said in his acceptance speech for Oppenheimer. âI imagine what it was like being 100 years into painting or theater. We donât know where that incredible journey is going from here, but to know that you think that I am a meaningful part of it means the world to me.â
Nolan arrives at his Oppenheimer moment not just as an accomplished filmmaker, but as a vocal industry leader for the theatrical experience, shooting on celluloid, blowing things up in real life, projecting on IMAX, and how much it sucked when Warner Bros. put all of its movies on HBO Max for an entire year. He has ruffled feathers over the years and rarely pandered, which may be the reason it took so long for him to score at the personality-driven Academy Awards. But that commitment to the craft created a cult of personality around him that has gone far beyond the usual film nerd community; during a summer of blockbusters, more people showed up for his three-hour historical biopic than the umpteenth Transformers movie. His Oscar win is a win for artists grappling with a business that seems to prefer more... artificial intelligence. 
If The Dark Knight upended expectations, maybe Nolanâs win for Oppenheimer will have a similar effect. As the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences scrambles to figure out how to lure more young folk to the Oscars telecast each year â remember when we almost got a Most Popular category? â and the movie studios sift through their IP file bins for anything toyetic they can throw $200 million at, the solution to the entertainment industryâs many woes seems to be staring everyone in the face. 
Nolan just won an Oscar for doing whatever his heart desired. Imagine if more people got the chance?",https://www.polygon.com/24096833/oscars-2024-christopher-nolan-oppenheimer,2024-03-11 02:07:55
The Oscarsâ Iâm Just Ken live performance was much more than Kenough ,"During the 2024 Oscars ceremony, Ryan Gosling took to the stage with everyone from Simu Liu to Slash to perform âIâm Just Kenâ â one of the breakout (and award-nominated) songs from Barbie. 
In the movie, âIâm Just Kenâ is a super heightened number, as the Kens rev themselves up for an inter-Ken world, and basically represents their idea of the patriarchy breaking at the seams. The Kens rally to fight each other with sports equipment and hobby horses, a big musical manifestation of their toxic masculinity. Eventually Goslingâs Ken and Simu Liuâs Ken bump chests and the sequence melds into a dream ballet, where the two factions of Kens have an aggressive dance-off. 
During the show, âIâm Just Kenâ started off right after the award for Best Sound, with Ryan Gosling in a sparkly pink suit crooning from behind Margot Robbie. He slowly sauntered up to the stage, joined by a group of dancers in tuxedos, pink sashes, and cowboy hats (including fellow Kens, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, and Ncuti Gatwa). The dancers proceeded to engage in a similar mock fight-dance, with Gosling karate chopping pink pieces of pink wood. Stage awash with pink light, Gosling continued to croon in a sea of giant Barbie face props, before joining Slash from Guns âN Roses rocking out on the guitar. Then, he went down into the audience to get the rest of the Barbie cast in on the action. 
It was, in a word, Kenough. 
âIâm Just Kenâ wasnât the only nominated song from Barbie. Billie Eilishâs âWhat Was I Made For?â, the melancholy number that plays at the end of the movie as Barbie realizes she wants to be more than just an idea, was also on the roster. Eilish and Finneas OâConnell, her brother and frequent collaborator, performed the number earlier in the night. In the end, it was âWhat Was I Made For?â that took home the Oscar gold â but âIâm Just Kenâ certainly was a fun time.

Jimmy Kimmelâs Oscars monologue ended on a moment of union solidarity ,"Jimmy Kimmelâs opening monologue for the 2024 Oscars started out pretty run-of-the mill. There were jokes about how Killers of the Flower Moon was long enough to âdrive to Oklahoma and solve the murders yourself,â a Madame Web shoutout, and a pretty good topical gag about the viral Republican rebuttal to the State of the Union address last week. But then Kimmel ended his monologue on something remarkable: a quippy, yet sincere and full-throated speech in support of Hollywoodâs labor unions. 
After the late-night host got some ribbing on the dual WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes last year with laugh lines both corny (âIf a movie premieres at The Grove and no actors are there to support it, does Mario Lopez make a sound?â) and shockingly barbed (making it clear he wasnât shouting out the Directorâs Guild of America, who âfolded immediatelyâ), Kimmel pivoted to sincerity. Hollywood, Kimmel said, âis at its heart, a union town,â and then proceeded to extend gratitude to the below the line labor unions: the truck drivers, Teamsters, and IATSE union members who supported striking Hollywood talent, calling for those present to support the IATSE in their ongoing negotiations with the studios). 
Last summerâs Hollywood work stoppage began with the Writerâs Guild of America beginning what would be a 148-day strike in May, and continued when SAG-AFTRA, the actorâs union, went on strike two months later, on July 14, for 118 days. At the heart of both union disputes with the studios were protections governing the use of artificial intelligence, as Kimmel noted by way of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts joke. 
Kimmel then called many of those union workers on stage in a genuinely moving demonstration of solidarity, closing out with one final joke: âIâm gonna make sure this show runs long so you get a ton of overtime.â

"600 Activision QA workers unionize, Microsoft voluntarily recognizes","Hundreds of Activision quality assurance workers are unionizing with the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The union covers approximately 600 Activision central QA workers across three locations: Austin, Texas; Eden Prairie, Minn.; and El Segundo, Calif. This makes the union, called Activision Quality Assurance United - CWA, the largest group of unionized video game workers in the U.S.
The final vote is tallied at 390 votes âyesâ and eight votes âno,â a CWA representative told Polygon.
âSomething we organized around is that in this industry, QA and customer service are the lowest paid jobs, and often looked down upon either within the industry or by customers,â Activision QA tester and organizing committee member Kara Fannon told Polygon. âItâs easy for people to say to QA, âOh, I found a bug,â even though we logged tens of thousands of bugs. So why is QA [unionizing], as opposed to other people in the industry? We have the weakest protections currently and we want to make sure that weâre strong so our work can keep going the way it is â we want to be supporting these games and working really hard on them.â

    Related
  
Activision Quality Assurance United - CWA members work on games published by Activision Publishing, including franchises like Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, and Tony Hawk Pro Skater. The group joins unionized Microsoft and Activision Blizzard employees at Blizzard Albany, Raven Software, and ZeniMax. 
The Blizzard Albany and Raven Software unions were brought under Microsoft with the companyâs $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard merger. Previously, ZeniMax Workers United was the largest group of video game industry QA workers at Microsoft and across companies in the U.S. with more than 300 workers.
Like the organizing efforts at ZeniMax, Activision QA workers reportedly did not face the union-busting tactics that were alleged to have occurred during Blizzard Albany and Raven Softwareâs union campaigns. Thatâs because Microsoft signed a labor neutrality agreement with CWA in 2022, which is basically a contract that says Microsoft must stay neutral in all union interactions. Agreements like this are not common, Risa Lieberwitz, professor of Labor Law and Employment Law at Cornellâs School of Industrial Labor and Relations and academic director for IRLâs The Worker Institute, told Polygon in 2023 after ZeniMaxâs union win.
âNow under Microsoft with the neutrality agreement they signed with CWA, itâs a lot easier,â Fannon said. âWe donât have to be concerned about any form of union-busting tactics. Microsoft made sure all managers were trained on neutrality. We knew that if we encountered union busting, we could bring it up so itâs addressed.â
The other positive is that neither Activisionâs QA workers nor Microsoft management have to go through the union election process with the National Labor Relations Board, which can sometimes take a while. Instead, Activision QA workers have been voting since Feb. 22 with either a union authorization card (a document, physical or digital, indicating approval of the union) or a confidential vote through an online portal.
Fannon added that the next step for the union is to enter into bargaining with Microsoft. But first, members will be surveyed to take stock of what issues are most important to the group. âOne great thing about a union is that itâs a democratic process,â Fannon said. âPeople have different ideas of what they want. Some things that are fairly common among people are wanting better pay â here in Minnesota, we donât make what would be considered a living wage.â
Fannon also pointed to better career development opportunities, increased benefits, and job security. Layoffs have created a major crisis for video game industry workers for the past couple years, and Activisionâs QA workers are thinking about their futures, too; better severance packages are important. A union canât always prevent layoffs, but it does empower workers to negotiate for their futures; in February, Sega of Americaâs union workers were able to save 18 jobs and negotiate better severance for those who were laid off. At Microsoft, ZeniMax QA union members were spared from a massive 1,900-person layoff in January. While union status may not have been a factor, some union members think it was.
Once itâs clear what union members want to fight for, theyâll head into negotiations, which entails the union and Microsoft going back and forth on a contract.
The news also means Activision QA workers from across the country are united; members are meeting people they might not otherwise come in contact with. That camaraderie is powerful, even outside of a contract â both in what it does for workplace solidarity, but also as a way to inspire the industry.
âItâs nice to know that everyoneâs gonna hear about this, and that people can be inspired to form their own unions,â Fannon said. âI went to a conference and there were some people who were part of Starbucks Workers United. They were talking and I was feeling so inspired. And then I realized, people might feel that way about what weâre doing. It hasnât really hit about how monumental it is. But it feels really good to be a part of.â 
Update (March 11): A Microsoft representative has provided a statement to Polygon. âWe maintained our commitment to remain neutral during the organizing campaign, and following this vote we recognize the Communications Workers of America (CWA) as the bargaining representative for the Activision Publishing Central Quality Assurance employees,â Microsoft deputy general counsel said. âWe look forward to continuing our positive labor management relationship.â ",https://www.polygon.com/24093254/activision-qa-600-workers-union-microsoft,2024-03-09 00:30:00
"Aquaria answers, âwhich anime character would win RuPaulâs Drag Race?â","Aquaria is drag royalty. The drag queen, performer, makeup artist, and model sky-rocketed to fame in 2018 after competing and eventually winning the 10th season of RuPaulâs Drag Race.
They also love anime, having professed their love for shows like PokÃ©mon and Yu-Gi-Oh!, and even cosplaying as Shinji Ikari from Neon Genesis Evangelion. Naturally, Aquaria was one of several dozen celebrities to walk the orange carpet of this yearâs Crunchyroll Anime Awards. 
Polygon had the opportunity to catch up with Aquaria during the event, where we asked them about the anime inspirations behind their fashion sense, their formative anime experiences growing up, and most importantly, which anime character in their opinion would have the best chance of winning RuPaulâs Drag Race? The answer: Team Rocketâs James from PokÃ©mon, duh!
@Aquaria is the expert, but who do you think would win??   #rupaulsdragrace #anime #pokemon 
âObviously James from Team Rocket in PokÃ©mon,â Aquaria told Polygon. âI feel like every episode she has to get into quick drag to go snatch some Pikachu [or other PokÃ©mon]. Her drag is always creative and unique and very nerve-giving and really talented.â
This yearâs Crunchyroll Anime Awards was a star-studded event, featuring appearances from the likes of Megan Thee Stallion, Dallas Cowboys Football star DeMarcus Lawrence, The Marvelsâ Iman Vellani, and more. 
Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 won over 11 awards in total, including anime of the year, breaking My Hero Academiaâs record of eight wins in 2018. More than 34 million votes were cast for this yearâs nominees, but the most important vote of all was Aquariaâs for James. Team Rocket is blasting off again!

"Artists, animators, musicians, and creators pay tribute to Dragon Ballâs Akira Toriyama","It will take decades for the world to fully unpack all the ways Akira Toriyama shaped our culture. The legendary artist and author, whose death was publicly announced Thursday, was a pioneer in manga, comics, anime, and video games, and his work formed a foundation for everyone in those industries who followed him. 
But Toriyamaâs presence and importance can be felt far wider than in just the fields he excelled at. Itâs hard to think of any single work thatâs been as consistently important in the lives of kids growing up as Dragon Ball, which has left its mark on every generation since Toriyama started writing it in the 1980s. Thanks to that fact, rappers, actors, journalists, directors, and just about every creative person you can imagine has had their work or their thinking shaped by Toriyama, in one way or another. 
Below weâve gathered just a few of the incredible tributes to the life, legacy, and work of Akira Toriyama, one of the most important creative thinkers of his generation.
RIP Akira Toriyama pic.twitter.com/kKq6N1Id6k
âHonestly, I donât know what to write or how to write about something so sudden.
However, for now, I would like to express my thoughts and feelings to Toriyama-sensei, something I wish he would have asked me someday.
I grew up with Dr. Slump in the lower grades of elementary school and Dragon Ball in the upper grades, and it was natural for me to have his manga next to me as part of my daily life. Even if I had a bad experience, watching Dragon Ball every week made me forget about it. It was a relief for me, a country boy who had nothing. Because Dragon Ball was really fun! It was when I was a university student. Suddenly, the Dragon Ball that had been a part of my life for so many years ended. I felt an incredible sense of loss and didnât know what to look forward to. But at the same time, it was also an opportunity for me to truly understand the greatness of the teacher who created Dragon Ball. I also want to create works like yours! I want to be like my teacher! As I followed in my teacherâs footsteps and aspired to become a manga artist, that feeling of loss began to disappear. Because making comics was fun. I was able to find new fun by following my teacher.
My teacher has always been my guide. I admired it. I apologize for the inconvenience, but I would like to express my gratitude to the teacher.
For me, he was the god of salvation and the god of manga.
When we met for the first time, I was so nervous that I couldnât say a word. However, after meeting him many times at the Tezuka Prize screening committee, we became able to talk.
As Dragon Ball Children, I and Mr. Oda went back to being children again, and when we talked excitedly about how much Dragon Ball was fun, as if we were competing with each other, I forgot that he looked like he was smiling a little shyly. I canât.
I have just received the news of the death of my teacher.
I feel an even greater sense of loss than when Dragon Ball ended...I still donât know how to deal with this hole in my heart.
Now I canât even read my favorite Dragon Ball. I donât feel like Iâve been able to properly write this sentence that I want to convey to my teacher.
Everyone around the world was still looking forward to seeing your work. If one Dragon Ball wish really comes true...Iâm sorry...Maybe thatâs selfish, but itâs sad, sensei.
Thank you, Akira Toriyama-sensei, for all the fun works you have done over the past 45 years.
And thank you very much for your hard work.
We are sure that the remaining family members are still deeply hurt. Please take care of yourself.
I pray that Mr. Akira Toriyama rests in peace.â
âItâs too early. The hole is too big.
The thought of never seeing you again fills me with sadness.
Iâve admired you so much since I was a child, and I even remember the day when you called me by name for the first time. I also miss the day when I had a great time with Mr. Kishimoto on the way home from the day when he used the word âfriendâ for us.
I also remember the last conversation we had. He is one of the people who took the baton from the era when reading manga would make you stupid, and created an era where both adults and children read and enjoy manga. He showed us the dream that manga can do things like this and that we can go to the world. He gave it to me. It was like watching a hero push forward. Not only manga artists, but creators active in all industries, the excitement and excitement of his Dragon Ball serialization is probably rooted in their childhood. That existence is a great tree. For manga artists of my generation who have stood on the same stage, the closer I got to Toriyamaâs works, the more I realized that they had a greater presence. Almost scary. But Iâm just happy to see the easy-going man himself again. Because we love Toriyama-sensei on a blood level.
I would like to express my respect and gratitude to the world of creativity left behind by Professor Toriyama, and pray for his repose in peace. I hope that heaven will be a pleasant world just as you envisioned it.â
ONE PUNCH MAN manga artist, Yusuke Murata reacts to Toriyama's passing.""There were many things that I received from Toriyama-sensei, the ones which only he could give. I pray that he may rest in peace.Strangely, I don't feel like he's passed away at all. Perhaps because forâ¦ https://t.co/rQiVoAth97 pic.twitter.com/hLdn5KGXJd
âToriyama-san taught me what it means to be a âprofessionalâ and what âworkâ is. I deeply respected him from the bottom of my heart. I sincerely pray that his soul may rest in peace.â
âI am still in disbelief at the news of Mr. Toriyamaâs death, which was so sudden.
Iâve known Toriyama-san since I was a writer for Shonen Jump, and with the recommendation of Toriyama-san, the editor in charge, I decided to ask him to draw the game when we launched Dragon Quest.
In the 37 years since then, I have been involved in character designs, monster designs, and countless charming characters.
The history of Dragon Quest is based on Toriyamaâs character designs. Toriyama-san, the late Sugiyama-sensei, were friends who worked on Dragon Quest for a long time.
That he would die...I donât know what else to say. Iâm really, really disappointed.â
âI donât want to believe it. My head is blank with a feeling that I donât want to think about it. Still, every time I see Goku, I remember what Toriyama-sensei said to me, âTake care of Goku for me, pleaseâ and that helps me to keep my mind clear.
âI vow to stay by Gokuâs side until my life is over.â
Sensei, please watch over us from heaven. May you depart in peace.â
RIP to one of the greatest mangaka to ever do it. Line work and character design were legendary. His work changed my life and so many others. Without Dragon Ball, Toonami would not have been what it became. Without his work, Anime would not be the global phenomenon it is today. https://t.co/eUJq02TpRP

Akira Toriyama was a legend. Chrono trigger is quite possibly my favorite video game of all time and dragon quest was one of the first RPGs I had ever played. A huge loss to gaming and anime. What an incredible and inspiring career. https://t.co/2Z2zy6GhaX
I will never forget the day Gokuâs power level went over 9000, and yes I cried when he went super saiyan on planet Namek. Thank you for the core memories to childhood that made growing up being a young black nerd ok. Your legacy will live on forever. R.I.P Akira Toriyama. pic.twitter.com/XGY1Uqodq5
I canât even believe it. This feels like the death of an ideaâ¦an ethereal being thatâs untouchable. No one had a bigger influence or reach as an artist. RIP, Toriyama. https://t.co/vsilEFiV3j
Toriyama Akiraâ¦ the absolute greatest. Everyone and I mean *everyone* is influenced by his legacy whether they even realize it or not.An absolute master who had nothing left to prove yet kept working in the industry in various ways regardless. I canât believe heâs gone.RIP
we lost one of the most influential artists in history of mankind.Toriyama-san has influenced & moved perhaps more than half the human population with his works.It's hard to process that he is not here anymore. He will always be in our hearts.Thank you Akira Toriyama-sensei
We are deeply saddened upon hearing of the passing of Akira Toriyama. We offer our sincere condolences to his family.Within our company, we have many staff members who worked and contributed to masterpieces such as ""Dr. Slump -Arale-"" and the ""Dragon Ball"" series and who allâ¦ pic.twitter.com/ZyuC2ptTVM

DC Comicsâ newest standalone book looks like actual magic,,https://www.polygon.com/24093759/mariko-tamaki-dc-comics-javier-rodriguez-zatanna-bring-down-the-houe,2024-03-08 17:00:00
Warner Bros. is now erasing games as it plans to delist Adult Swim-published titles,"Warner Bros. Discovery is telling developers it plans to start âretiringâ games published by its Adult Swim Games label, game makers who worked with the publisher tell Polygon. At least three games are under threat of being removed from Steam and other digital stores, with the fate of other games published by Adult Swim unclear.
The media conglomerateâs planned removal of those games echoes cuts from its film and television business; Warner Bros. Discovery infamously scrapped plans to release nearly complete movies Batgirl and Coyote vs. Acme, and removed multiple series from its streaming services. If Warner Bros. does go through with plans to delist Adult Swimâs games from Steam and digital console stores, 18 or more games could be affected.
News of the Warner Bros. plan to potentially pull Adult Swimâs games from Steam and the PlayStation Store was first reported by developer Owen Deery, who released puzzle-adventure game Small Radios Big Televisions through the label in 2016. Deery said on X Tuesday the game was being âretiredâ by Adult Swim Gamesâ owner. He responded to the companyâs decision by making the Windows PC version of Small Radios Big Televisions available to download for free from his studioâs website.
Polygon reached out to other developers who had worked with Adult Swim Games as a publisher. Two studios responded to say that theyâd received a similar warning from Warner Bros. Discovery, but they are still in the dark about what it means for their games.
Developer Michael Molinari, who released Soundodger+ through Adult Swim Games in 2013, told Polygon he received a warning from a Warner Bros. Discovery rep earlier this week that his game would be âremoved from Steamâ within the next 60 days.
âI donât know if theyâre delisting it or deleting it,â Molinari told Polygon in an email. âI pleaded with the rep to transfer ownership to my company, as I still retain all IP and game rights. I sent him a link to Steamâs transfer page and explained clearly that it takes literally three clicks to transfer ownership to me. He rejected my request.â
Molinari said the Warner Bros. Discovery representative said the decision not to transfer ownership back to developers âstems from logistical and resource constraintsâ and âthe limited capacity of our team.â (One developer Polygon spoke with said the current Adult Swim Games team consisted of a âskeleton crew.â) Molinari expressed frustration that WBDâs planned removal of his game and others would lead to âover a decade of downloads, community guides, reviews, and patch notes [...] suddenly vanishing.â
According to Molinari, Warner Bros. Discovery informed him that heâs allowed to republish Soundodger+ on Steam, but that option presents its own issues. Doing so âwould erase all my wishlists, reviews, community guides, and forum discussions, along with not allowing new and old owners of the game to compare achievements and trading cards,â Molinari said. 
âThe other legal requirement for republishing the game myself is to remove any and all mention of Adult Swim Games,â Molinari said. âI asked for clarification, and he even wants the credits sequence altered to remove the names of the [Adult Swim Games] team. Iâm a huge supporter of games preservation, and this is a direct blow to properly crediting the people that worked on a game.â
Matt Lewandowski, co-owner of studio Team2Bit, the developer behind the Adult Swim Games-published Fist Puncher, told Polygon that heâd also been contacted by Warner Bros. Discovery with a similar warning. Lewandowski said that a rep blamed the impending removal of Fist Puncher on âinternal business changes.â 
âWe requested that they transfer Fist Puncher back to our studio,â Lewandowski said. âTheir response was that they âcannot transfer the gameâ due to the fact that they âmade the decision not to transfer ownership due to logistical and resource constraints.ââ
Lewandowski said Team2Bit remains hopeful that WB Discovery will give Fist Puncher back to the studio.
âItâs been out for 11 years and we built a community around it through Steam,â he said. âWe also had an incredible experience working with Adult Swim over the years. The original team that helped us get Fist Puncher on Steam was passionate about elevating interesting and unique games from small studios. 
âThat said, if we do not get the current release of Fist Puncher transferred over to us, then we will likely re-release it under our own account. We still own the game and the IP so a re-release is certainly possible. And as someone who is passionate about preserving game history, I hate to see any game get lost to corporate red tape.â
Polygon reached out to 10 studios and solo developers who had their games published by Adult Swim Games to see what theyâve heard. Some say they havenât been contacted by WB Discovery, but they expect to. âFrom what Iâve heard from others, I will probably be hearing from them soon,â developer Andrew Morrish, who published Kingsway and Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe through Adult Swim, told Polygon. âItâs not looking good.â
Molinari said that if and when his game Soundodger+ is pulled from Steam, heâll republish it there âwith as little downtime as possible between the two versions.â The game is also available from Molinariâs itch page.
âAs an aside, I am beyond delighted I chose to self-publish Soundodger 2,â Molinari added, âas Iâd be devastated to have my two best-selling games on Steam removed with such short notice.â
Polygon has contacted Warner Bros. Discovery reps for comment on the companyâs plans to remove Adult Swim Gamesâ catalog and will update when the company responds.",https://www.polygon.com/24093815/warner-bros-adult-swim-games-steam-delisting,2024-03-08 15:45:00
Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama dies at 68,"Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama has passed away. On Thursday, March 7, a statement published on the official Dragon Ball website announced that Toriyama had passed on March 1 due to an acute subdural hematoma. He was 68 years old.
Toriyama was an acclaimed manga artist and character designer who first gained mainstream recognition in Japan through his sci-fi comedy manga Dr. Slump, published in Weekly ShÅnen Jump from 1980 to 1984. In 1984, Toriyama began publishing Dragon Ball, a martial arts adventure manga starring a young boy named Son Goku, which would go on to become his most famous work to date and one of the best-selling manga of all time.
The impact of Dragon Ballâs legacy on not only Japanese manga and anime, let alone global pop culture, is incalculable. The long-running anime adaptation of Dragon Ball produced by Toei Animation introduced an entire generation of audiences to the medium, transforming Goku into a globally recognized pop cultural figure and generational icon among anime fans.

Both the manga and anime have been championed as foundational works in the subgenre of Shonen adventure storytelling and have been cited as an inspiration to contemporaries including Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto and One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda. Both mangaka released public statements mourning Toriyamaâs passing, as well as My Hero Academia creator KÅhei Horikoshi, Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter x Hunter creator Yoshihiro Togashi, and Bleach creator Tite Kubo, among others. 
âWith respect and gratitude for the creative world he has left behind. I pray for his soulful rest in peace,â Oda wrote in a statement published on ShÅnen Jumpâs website. âMay heaven be the joyous world he envisioned.â 
âToriyama-san taught me what it means to be a âprofessionalâ and what âworkâ is,â Sakaguchi wrote in a statement published on X (formerly Twitter). âI deeply respected him from the bottom of my heart. I sincerely pray that his soul may rest in peace.â
Apart from his work on Dragon Ball, Toriyama also worked as a character designer and artist alongside Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii and Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi on the long-running RPG series Dragon Quest, the 1995 sci-fi fantasy RPG Chrono Trigger, and 2006âs Blue Dragon. A new Toriyama video game project will arrive this year; Sand Land, based on his 2000 manga, has been adapted into both an anime and a game set for release in April.
In 2021, it was revealed during a panel at San Diego Comic-Con that Toriyama had been overseeing the story and development of the 2022 film Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero alongside his son Sasuke Toriyama, who is presumed to oversee his fatherâs estate â and the Dragon Ball franchise going forward â following Toriyamaâs death. Prior to his passing, Toriyama had been working alongside his artistic protÃ©gÃ© Toyotarou in publishing the manga adaptation of Dragon Ball Super.
Dragon Ball Daima, the first Dragon Ball anime produced following Toriyamaâs passing and the last to feature his direct involvement, is scheduled to premiere later this fall.",https://www.polygon.com/24094335/dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-obtiturary,2024-03-08 15:29:02
Every RPG should pre-release a free character creator like Dragonâs Dogma 2 has,"Hereâs one of those things that, as soon as you hear about it, you canât understand why itâs not common practice. Capcom has released a demo for Dragonâs Dogma 2 which takes the simple but genius form of a free, full-featured character creator.
Every game with an in-depth character creator should do this in advance of release. If youâre looking forward to playing the game, or just curious, you get to enjoy a little prep work as a taster, tinkering and getting your characterâs look just right. And you can take your time doing it, without the unspoken pressure of the whole game sitting there, waiting to be played. You can obsess over the details of your cheekbones, hairstyle, and eye color to your heartâs content.
By the same token, come launch day â which, for Dragonâs Dogma 2, is March 22 â youâll be ready to dive straight in, potentially saving you hours before you can begin your quest. (Be honest, how long did you spend in the character creator before starting Baldurâs Gate 3?)
Prepare for your grand adventure! Get ready for launch on March 22 by downloading Dragon's Dogma 2 Character Creator ï¼ Storage to create your Arisen and main Pawn.Data can be transferred to the main game.#DD2 #DragonsDogma2 pic.twitter.com/9yx8PtxpvW
The Dragonâs Dogma 2 Character Creator & Storage is available now as a free download on Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. You can use it to create and store up to five Arisen player characters, and also customize the looks and inclination of up to five Main Pawn companion characters. The character data created in the app can then be transferred to the main game when it launches.
For the Arisen, you can choose from human and cat-like Beastren races and an admirably wide range of body types, and select your vocation from fighter, archer, mage, or thief. For Main Pawns, you can do all the above as well as choose their inclination: kindhearted (good for support characters), calm (defense and survival), simple (exploration and gathering), or straightforward (charges straight into combat). The detailed customization options are pretty impressive; as well as every cosmetic alteration you can think of, you can alter the characterâs posture and movement style down to the angle of their elbows and knees, giving them a confident swagger or a more hunched, cautious look.
Iâve downloaded the character creator on Steam and itâs pretty fun to tinker with. I can easily imagine having a few finely crafted Arisen and Pawns ready for adventure before the game arrives. This app is a win-win: itâs effective promotion and hype-building for the game,  and a genuinely useful service to players. Well played, Capcom. Other RPG developers: take note.

"Spider-Man 2 update mistakenly includes dev-only menu, leaking possible DLC","Insomniac Games released a big update for Marvelâs Spider-Man 2 on Thursday, adding promised features like New Game Plus, mission replay, time of day options, new spider-suits for Miles and Peter, and additional accessibility options. But the developer also included an unintended new feature in Spider-Man 2, one that players are being warned not to use.
PlayStation 5 owners quickly discovered that version 1.002.000 of Spider-Man 2 includes a developer-only debug menu that players can access with a few button presses. That menu lets players quickly skip around the gameâs chapters, turn on cheats, and view performance details, like frame rate and dynamic resolution settings.
It also reportedly gives players insight into possible DLC for Spider-Man 2. People have discovered a menu that shows chapters related to new missions that appear to feature Spider-Manâs longtime nemesis, the Beetle. Those details were previously datamined and indicated that the Beetle might be the Janice Lincoln version, daughter of Tombstone, who made her Marvel Comics debut in 2010.
Insomniac Games acknowledged the unintended inclusion of the debug menu in Spider-Man 2âs new patch, writing on X that it plans to hotfix the issue. It also cautioned players against using it, saying that doing so could interfere with game saves.
â ï¸ We're aware the latest game update may have inadvertently allowed access to a development game menu. There's a hotfix on the way.Please note that using this menu could corrupt your saves and trophy progress. There is no risk associated with playing the game as intended.
The slipup is an unfortunate oversight in what is otherwise a major and long-awaited update for fans of Insomniacâs Spider-Man games. Itâs also another dose of bad news for the PlayStation-owned studio, which was recently hit with layoffs amid cutbacks at Sony Interactive Entertainment and was the victim of a major data breach in December, which had a devastating impact on employees and spoiled the studioâs upcoming plans.
For players content to return to Marvelâs Spider-Man 2, untempted by the great power of a debug menu meant only for developers, thereâs a lot to chew on in the latest update. You can read Insomniacâs full patch notes at the studioâs website.",https://www.polygon.com/24093571/spider-man-2-update-debug-menu-insomniac-games,2024-03-07 21:50:00
"An interview with award-winning board game designer Eric Lang on his next game, Life in Reterra","If youâve ventured deep enough into the molten core of your neighborhood big box retailer, youâve likely seen them. Sitting there in neat little rows next to old standbys like Monopoly and Clue, near the endcap filled with expansions for Cards Against Humanity, is a new and insurgent class of products â the so-called âlight hobby board games.â That is, games that look and feel like their heavier cousins from the local game shop or online, but with the rough edges sanded down.
Award-winning independent game designer Eric Lang (Blood Rage) has no issues with them being there, but he thinks that modern consumers deserve more â and perhaps, better. Thatâs why he pitched Life in Reterra, alongside his co-designer Ken Gruhl, to 100-year-old board game publisher Hasbro. 
âMy personal point of view as a designer,â Lang told me in a recent interview, âis to prove that the lines between what we call âmass marketâ and âhobby marketâ are mostly illusion â illusion and artificial. People are people. Fun is fun. Depth is depth. Of course, everybody has different tolerances, or [wants] different amounts of depth in the game, but thereâs no one, weird, single, dividing line between what is in the mass market and whatâs not. Thatâs all been decided by buyers at retail.â
In Life in Reterra, players will draw tiles from a communal pool of resources in the hopes of building a settlement after an apocalypse. But unlike Clue and Monopoly, the box contains so many various components that youâll likely never play the same game twice. The starting hands of cards alone, Lang said, will have more than 11,000 different variations, which can scale from simple to more complex. Reterra is very purposefully trying to wheedle its way into playersâ lives, becoming a pastime that they return to again and again to toy with its complexity. Itâs every bit as complex as a traditional hobby board game, itâs just that itâs being presented differently.
Lang spent a good chunk of the last four years consulting with average consumers teaching them new games. The goal of immersing himself with folks who have never heard of Catan or Terraforming Mars was to quite literally unlearn what he has learned over years in the business, and to shake off the vernacular that has begun to proliferate thanks to the hobbyâs largest fansite, Board Game Geek (BGG).
âBGG is a taxonomy nerdsâ paradise,â Lang said. âEvery time a game mechanic is logged, they classify it. So when I say BGG terms: Worker placement? Like, what the hell does that mean? It means something very specific to the BGG crew, to a BGG-enfranchised user. Thatâs fine, but I consider that term verboten if Iâm going to reach [a wider audience]. It doesnât mean I canât use a mechanic like that, but I cannot consider it assumed knowledge, and I need to rethink why this mechanic exists.â
âMaking things simple is only one route into the mass market,â Lang added. âItâs just making things intuitive, and leveraging knowledge of non-hobby games rather than hobby games. If I ever do comparisons in this [work], I compare to mobile games, or the old Facebook games, or to classic games, and [Iâm careful to never make] the assumption that anybody understands anything that would be on BGG.â
That attention to craft extends to Life in Reterraâs manual itself, which at 12 pages is a whole lot longer than what youâd find with many traditional mass-market games â some of which comprise just a single double-sided page.
âThereâs a conventional wisdom [that] youâll lose them after one paragraph,â Lang said. âWith this game, if youâre buying a box that in big letters says âstrategy gameâ on it, we can assume people are going to want to play a strategy game. Weâre not going to lose them after one paragraph, but lots of white space, lots of illustrations, a little bigger than normal. Just no assumptions. Thatâs all.â

    Related
  
And the manual doesnât stop being useful after game one.
âThe thing thatâs new about this game,â Lang said, â[is that] we guide you through your first three games. We tell you, After your first game, flip two of these [tokens] over and see how much of the game changes. Oh, after that flip all five of them over. See how much it changes. And then we kind of walk them through the discovery curve. [...] We say, Hereâs a guided journey. Try this for your first few games. And that comes from my video game background. [When] teaching people complex games, [you] play as you learn.â
Life in Reterra is available for pre-order now at Target, with a listed release date of March 31.

Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 is going all in on Greek myths ,"Epic Games released a new trailer Thursday teasing Chapter 5 Season 2 of Fortnite, which releases Friday. Itâs called âMyths & Mortals,â and the brief, 20-second-long video shows cinematic footage of what could be new locations and a weapon that allows you to wield the god Zeusâ lightning powers. The trailer confirms previous information from official images and unofficial leaks that the new season will be Greek mythology-themed. 
TOMORROW   pic.twitter.com/Ue5rBwXl2G
The Season 5 Chapter 2 patch will be the first major update to hit Fortnite since the big Season 5 Chapter 1 update, which launched a new map last December. This smaller update will likely introduce a few new locations of its own. The cinematic trailer shows a celestial land that looks like Mount Olympus and a mysterious dark land that could be themed around the underworld â so maybe weâll get to go to those places in the game.  Unfortunately, the new trailer does not shed any light on the events prompted by the recent mysterious Titan Hand emergence.  
The trailer doesnât dive into any other details, but there may be more content coming to the game. Among the leaks, one that has fans buzzing is an Avatar: The Last Airbender collaboration that could bring skins and an in-game event tied to the theme. However, leakers and data miners have also said that Fortnite might also be getting skins inspired by the Persona series and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. All in all, itâs looking like it could shape up to be a fun season to play, but perhaps a bad one for my wallet.

Inside Out 2 trailer introduces a hodgepodge of new emotions and a million worldbuilding questions ,"After some teases, Pixar has revealed the rest of the new emotions in Inside Out 2. 
The first trailer introduced Anxiety (Maya Hawke), the bundle of nerves whoâs most likely going to guide Riley through her awkward teenage years. And in the new trailer, Anxiety brings her friends: Envy (Ayo Edebiri), who is surprisingly wide-eyed and in awe of everything; Ennui (AdÃ¨le Exarchopoulos), who immediately camps out on the couch with a disgruntled huff; and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser), a burly figure with a bright pink blush. 
The existing emotions â Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Liza Lapira) â must navigate Rileyâs first year of high school with these newcomers. And these teenage years are not easy. 
But hereâs the thing: where the heck are these other emotions in the adults we see? One of the charming quirks of the first movie was seeing brief glimpses of the emotions governing the other human characters. The trailer shows us a brief glimpse of Rileyâs motherâs mind, where we only see the standard five emotions. Does this mean Anxiety, Ennui, Envy, and Embarrassment are confined to the teenage existence? What happens to them after? Do they get absorbed by the main five? Do they disappear? 
(If so, sign me up for a world where being an adult means not having anxiety!)
Anyway, itâs not truly a Pixar movie if the trailers donât immediately blow open the doors with a million new worldbuilding questions. Maybe this will be addressed over the course of the movie, or maybe Inside Out 2 will be the new Elemental, which is the new Cars. 
Inside Out 2 hits theaters on June 14. ",https://www.polygon.com/24093549/inside-out-2-new-emotions-trailer-ennui-envy-embarassment,2024-03-07 19:12:25
Helldivers 2 is getting more electric in its first new battle pass,"Helldivers 2 is getting its first new battle pass since launch on March 14, and itâs sure to come in handy with the upcoming mech invasion. Arrowhead Game Studios announced on the PlayStation Blog Thursday that the new âWarbond,â as the battle pass is called in Helldivers 2, will focus on electric and energy-based weaponry and âultra-futuristic armor.â 
You can check out the new equipment in action by watching the official trailer, but hereâs a rundown. In terms of guns, youâll be able to unlock the LAS-16 Sickle (a short-burst laser rifle that doesnât require reloading), the SG-8P Punisher Plasma (a plasma shotgun), and the ARC-12 Blitzer (a gun that shoots lightning at close range). Thereâs also a new stun grenade and pistol.
The new armor is part of the EX Series Prototypes series, which at the time of writing doesnât do much beyond developing more hilarity for lore fans, with descriptions that say the armor canât be used ânear stapled paperworkâ or cost billions of Super Credits. These have been in development for at least 12 years in-game, and seem to possess some useful status effects. For example, the EX-03 Prototype 3 includes âa rubber underlayer for insulationâ while another generates a âstrong magnetic field.â 
To unlock items in the Warbond, players need to earn medals by completing missions or finding them as loot throughout the map. While some armor suits and helmets are available in the Superstore (the gameâs premium store that takes Super Credits, which can be bought with real-world currency), you can unlock armor, guns, grenades, and other cosmetics just by playing the game and earning rewards. Along with armor and guns, the battle pass will also feature new capes and three new emotes, which are arguably the most important additions. 
The new Warbond couldnât come at a better time for the gameâs community. While mechs, a new enemy type, havenât technically been announced, numerous leaks have surfaced, with some players even gaining access to the unreleased content. Theyâve also been teased heavily on the gameâs social media, with propaganda-styled posters announcing the new âEXO-45 Patriot Exosuitsâ and saying theyâre âready for deployment.â Helldivers have also just been called to liberate Tien Kwan, which is home to factories working on the suits. and has been attacked. The theory is that once the planet is liberated, the mechs will be available. 
There was also a new patch released Wednesday that nerfed some fan-favorite weapons but added fire tornadoes. So the game is changing up in a big way, arguably the biggest since the developers had to fix all the server and progression problems at launch.

My Adventures With Superman will continue this summer at DC Comics,"The story of My Adventures With Superman will continue at DC Comics, with a miniseries bridging the gap between its first and upcoming second season, written by show producer and writer Josie Campbell. 
Gorgeously realized by Studio Mir (Voltron: Legendary Defender, The Legend of Korra), MAWS was one of 2023âs best surprises. Campbell (Wonder Woman, New Champion of Shazam) brought a comic book sensibility to the show, which combined action and mystery with a romance-forward frame â Superman for a shojo audience. 
The season finale featured a battle against General Zod, an awkward Thanksgiving dinner with Loisâ hard-ass father, and the cliffhanger reveal that Jimmy Olsen sold his blog and is now a millionaire. Campbell and artist collaborator Pablo M. Collar (whose previous work includes Tales from Earth-6 and several DC and Marvel anthologies) seem poised to pick up exactly where the show left off: 
âClark Kent is a bit down and out, spending Christmas alone in Metropolis,â reads DCâs news release. âBut when he gets a tip about a monster in the sewers, Superman, Lois Lane, and Jimmy Olsen spring into action to investigate this mystery. What is this monster that can absorb anything it touches, and why is it here in Metropolis?â 
Campbell revealed that the story of the miniseries is one that was scrapped from the showâs first season for lack of space. âSo get ready for romance, comedy, super-powers, Jimmy Olsen talking a lot about how heâs super-rich now, and all the goodness of the show bundled into this action-packed miniseries.â

Crunchyroll execs respond to AI subtitle controversy and the Funimation merger,"In a recent interview with The Vergeâs Decoder podcast, Crunchyroll president Rahul Purini revealed that the anime-focused streaming service was experimenting with implementing AI-generated subtitles for the serviceâs library of titles. Puriniâs proposition was that AI could expedite the workflow of subtitling and closed captioning in order to launch episodes âas close to the Japanese release as possibleâ for worldwide anime fans.
Crunchyroll, which was acquired by Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. in 2021 and subsequently merged with Funimation in 2022, is arguably the largest streaming service dedicated primarily to Japanese animation. As of this past January, the post-merger subscriber base comes in at over 13 million. That market share combined with Puriniâs vision for potential implementation of AI subtitles prompted some anime fans and media commentators to voice concern.
The core argument: AI technology is nowhere near sophisticated enough to adequately translate the nuances of Japanese speech and text. Then thereâs the concern for how such AI would impact human translators and localization teams whose work forms the bedrock of simulcasting and simuldubbing anime.
Polygon spoke with Purini and Crunchyroll COO Gita Rebbapragada at the 2024 Crunchyroll Anime Awards to discuss the controversy and how Crunchyroll is considering the red flags from its audience.
âWe hear all of those concerns,â Rebbapragada told Polygon. âThe two things we are solving for are: We want to provide a meaningful viable alternative to piracy [and] we want to share in success with the creators and our partners. When the content is pirated, we are unable to share in that success with them and that is something thatâs very important to us.
âWe have to look at what technologies exist and how to deliver the best fan experience and the best ability to combat piracy. Weâre not different in that many companies are exploring this, and many pirate sites are exploring this. Now, having said that, anime is very unique. Itâs not like translating general entertainment. There are a lot of references, thereâs a lot of meaning, thereâs a lot of subtext. And we use human translators, obviously, right now, and I oversee the subtitling team, and they take an incredible amount of care to honor the creative intent behind the story. And so that is something we take really seriously. Itâs not something that we take for granted at all. And that is an important value for us.â
In an interview with Polygon, Purini clarified that Crunchyroll is not currently using AI in subtitling. 
âAI is new, we are curious to see what it can do, what it cannot do, to understand it better,â he said. âQuality is of paramount importance for us, and if we find out the technology is not to the level that it can create the best subtitles we want for our fans, then we will wait until the technology gets there. And if it never gets there, then it never gets there.â 
Purini declined to comment on a timeline when asked when and how Crunchyroll might implement AI-generated subtitling and closed captioning into the companyâs localization workflow. âWe still donât know if we can get them done. Itâs really, really early testing so far,â he said.
Additionally, Polygon spoke with Purini about the upcoming sunset of the Funimation app and website on April 2. This move, too, has not been without its share of controversy, as digital copies of anime purchased via home video sets distributed by Funimation and redeemable via the Funimation website will no longer be accessible following the closure of the Funimation app and website. 
âWe understand this is a value to fans,â Purini said when asked what the company is doing to serve customers frustrated by the impending inaccessibility of their digital copies. âWe are helping customers as they reach out to us on customer service. We are trying to make them whole. That could mean a discount to our subscription service, or it could mean giving them the value on a different service where they can get access to a digital copy.â
When asked if or when fans can expect the remaining anime titles on Funimation â titles such as Tenchi Muyo, The Vision of Escaflowne, and Serial Experiments Lain â that have not yet migrated over to Crunchyroll to be added to the latterâs streaming library, Purini told Polygon that company was still in the process of seeing those and more titles moved onto the platform. 
âWeâve been working really hard to move all that content from Funimation to Crunchyroll,â Purini said. âThe majority of that content has already been moved over to Crunchyroll. There are a handful of shows that are in the process of being moved over. I expect by April 2, everything that we can move over will get moved over. There might be a handful of shows that we do not get permission to move to Crunchyroll, and we will continue to work on those with our partners in the future.â",https://www.polygon.com/anime/24092569/crunchyroll-ai-subtitles-funimation-account-updates-interview,2024-03-07 17:00:00
New Fallout trailer gives us our best look yet at Walton Gogginsâ fascinating Ghoul,"A new trailer for Prime Videoâs Fallout TV series released Thursday gives us our best look yet at showâs grim post-apocalyptic story â and all the funny shit thatâs going to happen amid the suffering. We also get a better sense of who Walton Gogginsâ Ghoul character is, both before and after the nuclear apocalypse that establishes the foundation of Fallout.
The new Fallout trailer reveals that Gogginsâ Ghoul was seemingly a happy family man before the nukes dropped, and a slick salesman that sold space in the vaults in which survivors took refuge. The Ghoul may also be an uneasy ally of sorts to Lucy, Ella Purnellâs happy-go-lucky Vault Dweller character whoâs getting a harsh dose of reality on her journey across the wastelands of Los Angeles.
Lucy also gets some face time with Maximus (Aaron Moten), a young soldier in the Brotherhood of Steel, in the new Fallout trailer. Like Lucy, Maximus appears to have no shortage of optimism, but his is channeled toward the brotherhoodâs mission to bring law and order to the wasteland. Thursdayâs trailer also offers the first glimpse of characters Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury) and Ma June (Dale Dickey).
In a preview of the new Fallout trailer shown to press on Wednesday, Goggins said in video remarks that his Ghoul is akin to the poet Virgil in Danteâs Inferno. Goggins said his bounty hunter character serves as a âguide through this irradiated hellscape,â and is pragmatic, ruthless, and wields a wicked sense of humor. Before the war, when his character was named Cooper Howard, he was âa vastly different personâ and serves as the âbridge between the worldsâ of Falloutâs pre- and post-nuclear holocaust.
Fallout executive producer/director Jonathan Nolan said in a press conference on Wednesday that the tone of the TV series was the hardest thing to get right about the adaptation â right behind making the Brotherhood of Steelâs Power Armor suits look good in live-action. He said that the TV series, like the Fallout games, explores the end of the world with a sense of humor. âThereâs a thread of optimism woven into the show,â Nolan said. Co-showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet agreed, calling Fallout a âfun post-apocalyptic storyâ that will explore the various factions of the retro sci-fi world.
Robertson-Dworet also called the Ghouls of the wasteland âthe most empatheticâ faction, so expect to see plenty of Goggins and his irradiated mutant pals.
Fallout premieres on Prime Video on April 11 â a day earlier than previously announced. All episodes will drop at once.",https://www.polygon.com/24092714/fallout-tv-show-trailer-walton-goggins-ghoul,2024-03-07 14:00:57
Nintendo surprise dropped a Princess Peach: Showtime! demo ,"A free Princess Peach: Showtime! demo is available now on the Nintendo Switch eShop, Nintendo announced Wednesday. Nintendo surprise launched the demo ahead of the gameâs March 22 release date.
Princess Peach: Showtime! puts Peach in the spotlight for the first time in nearly two decades. Peachâs job? Saving the Sparkle Theater from villains Grape and the Sour Bunch. To save the theater, Peach joins different stage plays â sporting different costumes with unique skills â to take down the baddies. The free demo lets players put on the Swordfighter Peach and PÃ¢tissier Peach costumes to adventure across their respective levels. You can see several bits of Princess Peach: Showtime!âs gameplay in a new trailer released alongside the announcement â the clips show the aforementioned Swordfighter Peach, Ninja Peach, Figure Skater Peach, and a few others.

Nintendo also showed an additional mode, Rehearsal, where Peach can take on waves of enemies and earn rewards, like new ways to customize Peachâs outfits. (You can customize her companion Stella, too.) 
After playing Princess Peach: Showtime! at a preview event in February, Polygon called the game a âcharming, simple adventure,â but noted the game sometimes struggled to perform on the Nintendo Switchâs aging hardware. Princess Peach: Showtime! was first revealed in September 2023 after a teaser in June. Nintendoâs last game starring Peach is Super Princess Peach, which came out in 2005 for the Nintendo DS. Of course, you could also play as her in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which came out in October.
Princess Peach: Showtime! is out on Nintendo Switch on March 22.",https://www.polygon.com/24092883/nintendo-switch-princess-peach-showtime-free-demo,2024-03-07 01:46:40
Warner Bros. is killing Red vs. Blue production company Rooster Teeth,"After 21 years, Warner Bros. is shutting down Rooster Teeth, the production company behind Red vs. Blue and RWBY, among other titles. The process is expected to take several months, according to a notice from Rooster Teeth general manager Jordan Levin, published Wednesday on the Rooster Teeth website. The Roost Podcast Network, which boasts podcasts like Kinda Funny and RT Podcast, will stay with Warner Bros. as the company looks to sell the network.
Warner Bros. will still release a completed, unspecified Rooster Teeth-produced movie and other in-the-works projects, and is âexploring optionsâ for Rooster Teethâs content, according to Deadline. Variety reported Wednesday that around 150 full-time workers will be laid off, with âdozens of contractors and content creatorsâ suddenly impacted, too.
Levin attributed the closure to âchallenges facing digital media resulting from fundamental shifts in consumer behavior and monetization across platforms, advertising, and patronage.â
The company was founded in 2003, and with it came Red vs. Blue, a machinima-styled show that used Halo to tell a story about two groups of isolated, opposing soldiers dropped into a barren canyon. The show quickly became a hit; it took a game people loved â the original Halo â and created a parody of both wartime narratives and military video games. Most importantly, it was just funny â at least, it was to me as a teenager. Twenty-one years later, I still sometimes mumble a line from the first episode to myself: You ever wonder why weâre here? Red vs. Blueâs final season is slated for this year.
âThough not intentional, Itâs only appropriate that our last season of âRed vs. Blueâ coincides with us navigating this closure together,â Levin wrote. âOur legacy is not just a collection of content but a history of pixels burned into our screens, minds, and hearts. Rooster Teeth has made an indelible mark on the media industry, and we should be so proud of the countless ways we pioneered a business connecting creators and content with a dedicated community.â
Rooster Teeth eventually branched out from there, with shows like Achievement Unlocked and Letâs Play. Itâs next major hit, an anime-style web series called RWBY, debuted in 2013. The next year, Fullscreen acquired Rooster Teeth before the production company debuted its first movie, Lazer Team. That acquisition kicked off a string of mergers and restructurings that led to Rooster Teethâs consolidation under AT&T. AT&T tried to sell Rooster Teeth in 2021, saying its revenue dropped by $20 million in 2019. Rooster Teeth didnât get sold, so it was included in the AT&T deal that merged WarnerMedia with Discovery to create Warner Bros. Discovery.
Rooster Teeth, while still popular, struggled to maintain the janky charm and easy humor of its earliest days. The company also faced several serious controversies, including RWBY actor Vic Mignognaâs removal from the show after allegations of sexual harassment, as well as several instances of alleged workplace misconduct.
On social media, Rooster Teeth fans looked to support the companyâs laid-off staff, and called the imminent shutdown âan end of an era.â Though Rooster Teeth has changed a ton over the years â and not always for the better â a lot of people look back fondly on the works it created.

Persona 3 Reload DLC will add missing PS2 bonus chapter,"Persona 3 Reload, Atlusâ flashy, smash-hit remake of the pivotal PS2 game that cleared the way for Persona 5, was notable for what it was missing. Before the game even came out, fans and journalists wondered if the remake would include later additions to the original game, and the answer was, bafflingly, no. However, âno,â it turns out is not ânever,â and one of those big omissions will soon debut in Reload in the gameâs just-announced Expansion Pass. 
Revealed during the Xbox Partner Showcase, the Persona 3 Reload Expansion Pass will include ânew costumes, background music, and extended story content with Episode Aigis -The Answer-.â 
An epilogue added to the FES re-release of Persona 3, The Answer was a combat-focused follow-up set after the events of Persona 3 focused on the android Aigis. It was a pretty grueling experience light on the RPG social-sim flavor that made the base game great. Fortunately, further details in a post on Xbox Wire indicate that the epilogue will feature âcutting-edge graphics, modernized quality-of-life features and all the upgrades that came with Persona 3 Reload.â 
Unfortunately, the most interesting addition to Persona 3 â the option to play as a female protagonist added in Persona 3 Portable â is still missing in Reload. Hope springs eternal in video games, though, especially when thereâs money to be made via add-on content. At the very least, Persona 3 Portable is very easy to play these days. 
Episode Aigis -The Answer- will arrive Sept. in Wave 3 of the Expansion Pass, and will be available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers at no extra cost through January 31, 2025. Itâs considerably more substantial than the first two waves, which include the Persona 5 Royal EX BGM Set and Persona 4 Golden EX BGM Set in March, and the Velvet Costume & BGM Set in May. Non-subscribers or Persona 3 Reload owners on other platforms will be able to purchase the Expansion Pass when it launches on March 12 for $34.99.

"Creatures of Ava looks like a sweet alternative to Palworld, with hugs instead of guns","Anyone whoâs played PokÃ©mon long enough might become a bit cynical about the gamesâ creature collection aspects. Youâre trapping, breeding, and battling those adorable creatures, and in the case of the PokÃ©mon-inspired Palworld, even conscripting them into forced labor. A new creature-collection game, Creatures of Ava, is taking a different approach: What if you were nice to the animals?
Developers Inverge and Chibig revealed Creatures of Ava on Wednesday, showing how players will take on the role of young-adult adventurer Vic on a mission to tame and collect wild fantastical beasts. But instead of ensnaring them in a ball-shaped prison, Vic uses a flute (and hugs and bellyrubs) to lure the gameâs creatures back home with her. The mission is to cure them of a widespread infection thatâs making the monsters of Creatures of Ava aggressive.
Publisher 11 bit Studios describes Creatures of Ava as an action-adventure game with a story of âwonder, mystery, and discovery.â The gameâs narrative is co-created by writer Rhianna Pratchett (Tomb Raider, Thief) and promises to challenge players âto step out of the human-centric point of view and learn about the real toll it takes to preserve the primal beauty at the very roots of Ava.â
Creatures of Ava doesnât appear to have the breeding and evolution mechanics of PokÃ©mon games, at least based on the gameâs debut trailer. But it does let players traverse the planet and solve environmental challenges with tamed creaturesâ help. Plus, you can snap pics of them.
If non-violent creature collecting and flute playing sounds like your speed, Creatures of Ava will launch sometime this year on Windows PC and Xbox Series X â and it will be available on Game Pass day one.",https://www.polygon.com/24091654/creatures-of-ava-xbox-pc-game-pass,2024-03-06 19:00:00

Youâll believe an Adam Sandler can fly in this behind-the-scenes look at Spaceman,"Netflixâs new Adam Sandler movie is unique in the Sandman canon: Despite sending the comedic actor to space for an encounter with an oversized alien spider, most of the potentially corny laughs are swapped for melancholic tears. Like Solaris, The Fountain, and Ad Astra before it, director Johan Renckâs Spaceman is a meditative intragalactic drama orbiting around a heartfelt performance from Sandler. Itâs not the first movie with the kind of visual effects that demand an actorâs unbridled imagination, but filming Spaceman was a test that took him outside his comfort zone.
âIn Jack & Jill, my twin sister was a tennis ball,â Sandler joked to Polygon earlier this month. âIâve had moments [with visual effects], but not a full movie, and not a movie where I was on wires, and not a movie where I had to cry. I never cried in front of a tennis ball before. I mean, one time at the Jewish Community Center when we lost the match. But thatâs when I was 7. A long time ago.â
Adapted from Jaroslav KalfaÅâs 2017 novel Spaceman of Bohemia, Renckâs film casts Sandler as Jakub, a Czech astronaut whoâs starting to crack eight months into his solo journey to Jupiter. If isolation wasnât enough, his wife back home has stopped speaking to him. Luckily, a talking spider (voiced by Paul Dano) has appeared on board the ship.
Unlike his dramatic turns in Punch-Drunk Love and Uncut Gems, Spaceman demands Sandler dig deep while zipping around in zero gravity, an effect pulled off with an intricate system of wires and mechanical-arm rigs. Itâs not a surprising method, but it does look like an absolute pain in the ass â a form of movie magic I can never get enough of. This exclusive look at the making of Spaceman gives you a peek into how Sandler made it all work, from crying at tennis balls to the more elaborate choreography required to navigate his claustrophobic set.

The new Xbox Partner Preview will stream live on March 6 at 1 p.m. EST/10 a.m. PST on Xboxâs YouTube and Twitch channels. Microsoft promises a âno frillsâ series of updates on a variety of Xbox and Windows PC games.

"Helldivers 2 patch nerfs the best builds, but throws in fire tornadoes","Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios rolled out a new patch for the game on Wednesday thatâs going to have an impact on how youâre managing democracy across the galaxy. Patch 01.000.100 for Helldivers 2 brings with it some serious nerfs to fan-favorite weapons like the Breaker and Railgun, as well as the Energy Shield Backpack.
But at least you could get incinerated by a fire tornado, thanks to new planetary hazards added in Helldivers 2âs new patch, which is out now on PlayStation 5 and Windows PC. So itâs not all bad!
If youâre not running one of Helldivers 2âs go-to builds, and are instead a big fan of flamethrowers or the Punisher, you might feel differently about the gameâs new patch. Arrowhead developers say that the nerfs arenât intended to sap the fun from the gameâs best guns, but to make everything shine. Hence, buffs to a lot of the gameâs lesser utilized weapons and stratagems.
âOur goal is to give you a wide range of weapon choices, where each gun has its purpose and none is strictly better than another,â Arrowhead developer Alex K said on the official Helldivers Discord. âSure, you will have your own favorite, but it should come from your personal preference, not from the universally agreed knowledge of which gun is the strongest.â
Hereâs what some of those changes look like, from Arrowheadâs patch notes:
Naturally, some players havenât responded too kindly to seeing their beloved Railgun nerfed, but Arrowhead urges players to reevaluate their loadouts and give the changes a chance to gel.
Arrowheadâs Alex K notes that the Breaker, Railgun, and Shield Generator Backpack âwere quite strong with too little downsides, overshadowing all other options on higher difficulty levels.â 
âHowever, we strongly believe that the changes wonât ruin this build, but rather help the affected items find their place among the other options and stay effective in capable hands,â the developer said. âOn a more personal note, I know that having your favorite toy nerfed absolutely sucks. Investing countless hours into mastering a weapon is an incredible dedication from you. which is the main reason weâre making this game in the first place. And then having that weapon weakened feels like a punishment for being too good at the game. But I implore you not to compare a changed item with its older version, but to evaluate the existing one as it is and see if it still has a place in your heart.â
On a more hopeful note, Helldivers will soon get a little more help in the field thanks to the impending arrival of mechs, which Arrowhead says will be coming âsoon.â

The new Fallout-themed controllers will set you back more than a few caps,"The Fallout hype train is working overtime to get everyone excited for the April 12 launch of the Fallout TV Show on Prime Video. In addition to the announcement of Fallout S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Anthology of games that you can pre-order, and Prime Gaming even offering some PC titles for free for Prime subscribers, Xbox has just announced a new Fallout-themed customization option joining the Xbox Design Lab.  
The new design features a collage of different iterations of Vault Boy, the official mascot of the Fallout franchise, in addition to a Vault-Tec-themed Xbox logo at the top of the controller. Iâll admit that the new treatment looks pretty cool, but the extra cost is questionable. It costs $5 more than the other custom designs, yet Iâm not sure that itâs worth it. Something about paying $84.98 (at minimum) for an Xbox controller doesnât sit right with me. 
Just like the rest of the custom color treatments available from the Xbox Design Lab, the new Fallout theme can be combined with the bevy of other customization options. If you make the triggers and D-Pad metallic, you can spend close to $100 before tax. 

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
The Xbox Design Lab lets you make a bespoke Xbox controller with an amazing variety of color and design options. Each controller starts at just $70, but for an additional $10, you can get an embarrassing custom message engraved on it. 
In defense of this new design, itâs not like other Design Lab controllers are affordable. Heck, Iâm personally guilty of spending $149.95 on my own custom Elite Series 2 controller from the Xbox Design Lab. But this Fallout theme isnât the fantastic Elite controller. Itâs just Microsoftâs standard (yet very good) wireless controller, which can purchased in white at Amazon for $45. At $80 and higher, Microsoft is testing the limits of what people are willing to pay for a cosmetic upgrade to a controller hasnât changed in roughly four years.",https://www.polygon.com/deals/24091456/fallout-xbox-controller-design-lab-costs-how-much,2024-03-05 19:56:02
The banned trans Joker movie finally has a trailer and a theatrical release,"Back in 2022, Vera Drewâs highly personal, incredibly irreverent stylized memoir movie The Peopleâs Joker made a splashy debut at the Toronto International Film Festival: DC Comicsâ parent company, Warner Bros., strongly warned Drew and TIFF that the movie might violate copyright, so after the premiere, they shut down all subsequent screenings, throwing the movieâs future into doubt. Itâs taken years for The Peopleâs Joker to see the light of day, outside of the occasional festival screening. I saw it at the 2023 Fantastic Fest, where Vera Drew was present to talk about the experience, but was careful not to address the question of whether her film might ever get a real theatrical run. But now, according to the poster, itâs âcoming soon. Legally. Seriously.â
The Peopleâs Joker has finally been cleared for release, albeit covered in disclaimers reminding everyone that it isnât an official DC project, and that its satirical takes on Batman, the Joker, Harley Quinn, the Penguin, and other comics characters arenât canon or affiliated with WB products. Not that anyone whoâs ever seen the movie could make that mistake. The Peopleâs Joker is unmistakably a personal story â specifically, a transgender awakening and coming-out story, complete with a first queer romance and a journey of self-definition.
Itâs patterned somewhat after Todd Phillipsâ Joker, but itâs unmistakably its own riotous, gleeful, deeply emotional creation, a genre mashup that uses costuming, simple animation effects, digital veneers, and goofy props to stylize Veraâs coming-of-age story by turning it into a pop-art odyssey. Hereâs the official description:
In the absurdist autobiographically-inspired dark comedy that boldly reimagines the Jokerâs origin, a painfully unfunny aspiring clown (Vera Drew as Joker the Harlequin) grapples with her gender identity while unsuccessfully attempting to join the ranks of Gotham Cityâs sole comedy program in a world where comedy has been outlawed. Uniting with a ragtag team of rejects and misfits, Joker the Harlequin forms an illegal anti-comedy troupe that puts her on a collision course with the devious caped crusader controlling the city. 
THE PEOPLEâS JOKER features cameos from comedy multi-hyphenate Tim Heidecker, award-winning actor Bob Odenkirk, Maria Bamford (Netflixâs Big Mouth, Adult Swimâs Teenage Euthanasia), and Scott Aukerman (Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis co-creator and host of the Comedy Bang! Bang! podcast), with Vera Drew, Lynn Downey (Amazon Prime Videoâs Daisy Jones & The Six), Nathan Faustyn (SADDLED), and Kane Distler, in his film debut, making up the filmâs core cast. With her own life as a trans woman and artist motivating the filmâs story and theme, the script was co-written by close creative collaborator Bri LeRose (Netflixâs Magic for Humans and Chad & JT Go Deep).
The Peopleâs Joker will open April 5 in New York at the IFC Center, and expand across the U.S. and Canada over the course of April and May. You can find a list of participating theaters and screening dates at the movieâs website.",https://www.polygon.com/24091473/the-peoples-joker-2022-vera-drew-movie-trailer-release-date,2024-03-05 19:36:54
"DreamWorksâ new movie The Wild Robot blends Star Wars, The Iron Giant, and more","DreamWorks revealed the first trailer for its upcoming animated movie The Wild Robot on March 5, and it teases a pretty gorgeous movie, full of vibrantly colorful wildlife and vivid, stylized takes on natural settings. And smack in the middle of it is a robot that seems mighty familiar â but familiar in different ways in practically every shot.
Initially, the robot, Roz (voiced by Lupita Nyongâo), looks like a head atop a rolling ball â a dead ringer for the Star Wars sequel seriesâ BB-8. But then it pops out limbs and starts looking a lot more like the attenuated, abandoned robot from Hayao Miyazakiâs Castle in the Sky. It has big, goggly, sad eyes that evoke Wall-E from WALL-E; a mostly featureless yet evocative face reminiscent of Baymax from Disneyâs Big Hero 6, and color-shifting eyes and soulful behavior reminiscent of the title character in The Iron Giant. The trailerâs only spoken words â a voiceover proclaiming, âSometimes, to survive, you must become more than you were programmed to beâ â evoke the central message of The Iron Giant as well. Thereâs scarcely an animated or CG movie robot from the past 25 years that doesnât get a cheery little nod somewhere in Rozâs design or behavior.
The various animal characters in the trailer are more uniquely designed, but this initial teaser downplays them and doesnât even reveal that they talk â a little odd, since many of them are voiced by very familiar actors, from Mark Hamill to Pedro Pascal to Matt Berry. Itâs likely that later trailers will focus less on the movieâs mood and image, and more on those animal characters and the filmâs plot. But for the moment, this trailer feels simultaneously like a showreel of very handsome animation, a nostalgia-courting love fest for decades of popular animated mechanical protagonists, and a weird dodge around the movieâs actual story, the way trailers for Wonka and the 2024 Mean Girls both dodged around revealing that those movies are musicals. 
Hereâs DreamWorksâ rundown on the filmâs storyline and cast:
The epic adventure follows the journey of a robot â ROZZUM unit 7134, âRozâ for short â that is shipwrecked on an uninhabited island and must learn to adapt to the harsh surroundings, gradually building relationships with the animals on the island and becoming the adoptive parent of an orphaned gosling.
The Wild Robot stars Academy AwardÂ® winner Lupita Nyongâo (Us, The Black Panther franchise) as robot Roz; Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us, The Mandalorian) as fox Fink; Emmy winner Catherine OâHara (Schittâs Creek, Best in Show) as opossum Pinktail; OscarÂ® nominee Bill Nighy (Living, Love Actually) as goose Longneck; Kit Connor (Heartstopper, Rocketman) as gosling Brightbill and OscarÂ® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once, this summerâs The Fall Guy) as Vontra, a robot that will intersect with Rozâs life on the island. 
The film also features the voice talents of Emmy winning pop-culture icon Mark Hamill (Star Wars franchise, The Boy and the Heron), Matt Berry (What We Do in the Shadows, the SpongeBob movie franchise) and Golden Globe winner and Emmy nominee Ving Rhames (Mission: Impossible films, Pulp Fiction).
A powerful story about the discovery of self, a thrilling examination of the bridge between technology and nature and a moving exploration of what it means to be alive and connected to all living things, The Wild Robot is written and directed by three-time OscarÂ® nominee Chris Sanders â the writer-director of DreamWorks Animationâs How to Train Your Dragon, The Croods, and Disneyâs Lilo & Stitch â and is produced by Jeff Hermann (DreamWorks Animationâs The Boss Baby 2: Family Business; co-producer, Kung Fu Panda franchise). 
Peter Brownâs The Wild Robot, an illustrated middle-grade novel first published in 2016, became a phenomenon, rocketing to #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. The book has since inspired a trilogy that now includes The Wild Robot Escapes and The Wild Robot Protects. Brownâs work on the Wild Robot series and his other bestselling books have earned him a Caldecott Honor, a Horn Book Award, two E.B. White Awards, two E.B. White Honors, a Childrenâs Choice Award for Illustrator of the Year, two Irma Black Honors, a Golden Kite Award and a New York Times Best Illustrated Book Award.
The Wild Robot debuts in theaters on Sept. 20. More information is available at the movieâs website.",https://www.polygon.com/24091281/dreamworks-the-wild-robot-2024-movie-trailer-series,2024-03-05 17:43:53
MLB The Show 24 looks to the past and future for women in baseball,"Over the last few years, sports sims have started to make strides towards not just being accurate recreations of professional athletics, but playable documentaries that examine the legacies of star players and historic moments. Of the big annual sports franchises, Sony San Diego Studioâs MLB The Show is rapidly becoming the most interesting â the studio is following up its tremendous Storylines mode about baseballâs Negro Leagues with a new career mode centered on women.
Called Road to the Show: Women Pave Their Way, the mode is effectively a second Road to the Show campaign, with all of the career modeâs features in addition to âa unique-to-women storyline following a lifelong friendship as it develops in professional baseball.â
That last bit, according to narrative designer Mollie Braley, is important. Itâs not enough, she argues in a promo interview at the PlayStation Blog, to merely add women to The Showâs career mode, but to illustrate âthe immense importance of community and support amongst the small but ever-growing group of women in baseball.â
To that end, the women players create in the mode will have a buddy character named Mia Lewis, a childhood friend and fellow baseball player who will function as âa sounding board, a support system, and a competitive player in her own right, and your relationship with her in-game will grow and evolve throughout your career.â
In addition to Women Pave Their Way, MLB The Show 24 will also bring a second season of its Storylines mode featuring the Negro Leagues that will include âThe Trailblazerâ Toni Stone â âthe first woman to play professional baseball regularly in a major menâs professional baseball league.â
While they still arenât getting the massive marketing push that their male counterparts have received in annual sports games for decades, women are increasingly becoming a core part of the sports sim experience. NBA 2K and FIFA follow-up franchise EA FC both feature women in their games, and 2Kâs last three releases have come with alternate WNBA cover stars. MLB The Show 24, however, feels unique in the considered and thoughtful way itâs starting to round out its excellent baseball sim with narrative modes that engage with both the past and future of the sport.

Did not expect this kind of lore from NASAâs first tabletop game,"NASA has released a free, original tabletop role-playing game, and itâs one part educational experience and another part sci-fi/fantasy epic with magic and dragons.
The crux of The Lost Universe, the organizationâs first TTRPG, involves a mystery: What would happen if the Hubble Space Telescope disappeared? Itâs a simple premise and one that hides the complex backstory underscoring the events of the role-playing game. Without getting into the weeds, the game takes place on a planet called Exlaris, which was once thrown into chaos when a black hole moved too close and kicked it out of its orbit. The planet has since gone back to some degree of normalcy and is now almost completely dedicated to academia. In one city, a scholar named Eirik Hazn made a spell to connect with Earth to study the Hubble Space Telescope, which has famously collected data on black holes. However, the spell and telescope are stolen by a dragon, and researchers working on the project have been disappearing, so the players â  Earthlings who worked on the telescope at NASA who were brought through a portal to Exlaris â have to save the day. 
The official 44-page gameplay book is available to download for free on NASAâs website. You can play it in a party with 4-7 players, but you may need to fudge a few things to graft this narrative onto your TTRPG system of choice. The book says itâll take around 3-4 hours to get through the adventure.
Donât let the heavy fantasy elements distract you from the educational aspects of the game, which is all about the Hubble Space Telescope and its importance to Earthâs history. The space telescope has taken some famous images of our universe, including of faraway galaxies and nebulas, and has helped us understand how many of these bodies work and how they evolve. If you scroll through the rulebook, a lot of the text involves explaining scientific concepts like gravitational lensing â the idea that a large enough grouping of matter can distort light as it travels toward the observer.
A lot of the lore is also filled with references to Hubble and NASA. For example, Hazn has the same initials as Edwin Hubble, the astronomer whom the telescope was named after. Then there are some of the âmagicalâ concepts used to flesh out the story, too: the energy the Exlari people use is based on dark matter.
The Lost Universe was made in conjunction with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and its credits are filled with NASA employees from various departments. The lead on adventure design is Christina Mitchell, who is a video producer, and Michelle Belleville, a web design lead, was in charge of graphic design. Other contributors include people from the Hubble team and Earth Science Outreach.

"Nintendo wins $2.4M in Switch emulator lawsuit, Yuzu to shut down","Makers of Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu owe Nintendo $2.4 million after reaching a settlement with the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom developer, following a lawsuit over the open-source emulator just last week. Both Nintendo and Tropic Haze, the company behind Yuzu, filed for a final judgment and permanent injunction on Monday, according to court documents, after Nintendo accused the Yuzu makers of copyright infringement, circumvention of Nintendoâs Switch protections, and selling those circumvention technologies as Yuzu, among other things.
The settlement is pending a judgeâs approval, however.
Yuzu is a free Nintendo Switch emulator that was released in 2018 months after Nintendo launched the Nintendo Switch. Itâs a piece of software that lets people play Nintendo Switch games on their computers or phones â including Tears of the Kingdom, which Nintendo cited in its lawsuit, saying Yuzu let people play leaked copies of the game early. Specifically, Nintendo said more than 1 million people played the game before the release date because of the leaked copies. Yuzu doesnât offer pirated or leaked games itself, but Nintendo targeted the company because the emulator is one of the few ways to play those games.
Beyond the money, the terms of the settlement dictate Tropic Haze will have to stop operations on Yuzu entirely â it canât distribute it in any way, nor can it market it on its website or social media. Yuzu will also have to give up its domain name. 
In a statement published on Discord, Yuzu maker Bunnei confirmed that anything related to Yuzu will come offline.
âPiracy was never our intention, and we believe that piracy of video games and on video game consoles should end. Effective today, we will be pulling our code repositories offline, discontinuing our Patreon accounts and Discord servers, and, soon, shutting down our websites,â Bunnei wrote. âWe hope our actions will be a small step toward ending piracy of all creatorsâ works.â
The website, Patreon page, and GitHub repositories for both Yuzu and Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra have all been taken offline. The Discord channel remains online.
A Nintendo representative pointed Polygon toward the Entertainment Software Association when reached for comment on the settlement. Lawyers for the emulator maker did not respond to a request for comment.
The Tears of the Kingdom publisher is known to be strict with its intellectual property. Nintendoâs won several lawsuits targeting pirated game sites like RomUniverse, where it was awarded more than $2 million in damages. Nintendo also notoriously went after an alleged Nintendo Switch hacker named Gary Bowser, who was arrested and charged for selling Switch hacks. Though heâs been released from prison, Bowser still owes Nintendo $10 million; he paid Nintendo $175 while in prison from money he earned working in the prison library and kitchen.
The Nintendo and Yuzu lawsuit has ignited once again a debate on emulation â whether the act of emulation is inherently illegal. Of course, emulation fans donât believe that: A lot of people see Yuzu and other emulators as an important tool for video game preservation. Nintendo, clearly, disagrees.
Update: Bunnei, one of Yuzuâs creators, published a message addressing the settlement on the groupâs Discord page, where they said all Yuzu code, Patreon accounts, and Discord servers will be shut down. Weâve updated this story to include a portion of this statement. Hereâs the full message:
Hello yuz-ers and Citra fans:
We write today to inform you that yuzu and yuzuâs support of Citra are being discontinued, effective immediately.
yuzu and its team have always been against piracy. We started the projects in good faith, out of passion for Nintendo and its consoles and games, and were not intending to cause harm. But we see now that because our projects can circumvent Nintendoâs technological protection measures and allow users to play games outside of authorized hardware, they have led to extensive piracy. In particular, we have been deeply disappointed when users have used our software to leak game content prior to its release and ruin the experience for legitimate purchasers and fans.
We have come to the decision that we cannot continue to allow this to occur. Piracy was never our intention, and we believe that piracy of video games and on video game consoles should end. Effective today, we will be pulling our code repositories offline, discontinuing our Patreon accounts and Discord servers, and, soon, shutting down our websites. We hope our actions will be a small step toward ending piracy of all creatorsâ works.
Thank you for your years of support and for understanding our decision.
Update (4:58 p.m. ET): This story has been updated after the Yuzu and Citra makers took the code, Patreon page, and website offline.",https://www.polygon.com/24090351/nintendo-2-4-million-yuzu-switch-emulator-settlement-lawsuit,2024-03-04 21:58:00
The Last of Us season 2 is casting up,"The Last of Usâ first season has come to an end, but thereâs more to Joel and Ellieâs story than one season of TV could tell. Unfortunately, HBO hasnât revealed too much about the next season of the show, beyond the fact that itâs happening. We donât even know when season 2 might arrive, but given HBOâs habit of waiting two years between the first two seasons of its biggest shows (like Westworld or likely House of the Dragon) it seems like we could be waiting awhile to return to The Last of Usâ Cordyceps apocalypse. 
The showâs first season adapted the story of The Last of Us Part 1, the first game in the franchise, and one thing we do know is that season 2 will focus on the story of The Last of Us Part 2. Aside from that, hereâs everything you should know about The Last of Us season 2 after watching the first seasonâs finale. 
Thereâs no word yet on when exactly The Last of Us might get its second season, but we do know itâs on the way. Based on HBOâs production schedule for some of its other big series, we shouldnât necessarily expect the customary TV break of just one year between seasons of The Last of Us, which likely brings the second seasonâs release date to 2025 or even later. 
This timeline got a bit more unofficial support from series star Bella Ramsey when she told The Independent that the second season wasnât likely to come until âend of 2024, early 2025.â
In the vaguest terms, The Last of Us Part 2 deals with the consequences of Joelâs actions at the end of Part 1. If the (very general) theme of the first game is love, the second game is more about hatred, with most of its run time dedicated to vengeance. If you thought season 1 was bleak, get ready!
Did Joel do the right thing at the end of The Last of Us season 1?
The Last of Us Part 2 takes place a few years after the events of the first game, which means that The Last of Us season 2 will likely have a time skip as well. However, Part 2 does include some flashbacks from the intervening years, so it all depends on how HBO chooses to adapt the story, and in what order.
Probably! Their characters will be, at the very least. And while some fans online have expressed a bit of concern about Bella being too young for Ellieâs storyline in The Last of Us Part 2, sheâs actually exactly the same age as the character in the game already. More importantly, showrunner and co-creator Craig Mazin has already said that there are no plans at all to recast Ramsey â who was one of the best parts of season 1.  
Itâs possible, but probably not. Officially, The Last of Us has only been renewed for season 2 and not anything further than that, but given its popularity itâs likely to get as many seasons as Mazin and co-creator Neil Druckmann would like. As for how many that might be, the two confirmed to GQ after the first season finale that they donât feel the story of The Last of Us Part 2 can be adapted into just one season of television. Mazin is tight-lipped about just how many seasons the pair plan to adapt the game into, only saying that itâs âmore than one season.â
No TLoU on HBO tonight. But Season 2 is already on its way! Endure & survive! pic.twitter.com/87bKKCDBeO
The Last of Us season 2âs first big tease was an image tweeted out by Druckmann on March 19, 2023. The image features an unknown personâs arm holding a hammer. While this may seem like a big mystery to show-watchers, anyone who has already played The Last of Us Part 2 will know that this is likely a tease of Abby, one of the most important characters in the game. 
Supposing Mazin and Druckmann follow the plot of the second game at all, Abby will have a massive role to play in the story, and one that might complicate the moral universe of the series and our ideas about who the heroes and villains of this story might be. While this tease is pretty overt, there still hasnât been an official announcement about who will play Abby in HBOâs series, or if sheâll even be part of the second season.  
Any discussion of who exactly Abby is, what sheâs like, or her importance to the plot would involve quite a few spoilers from the game that are better left unsaid while we wait for season 2, but for now we can just say that sheâs a member of the Fireflies with a very direct personal connection to Joel. 
On Jan. 9, 2024, HBO announced Kaitlyn Dever, known for her roles in No One Will Save You and Booksmart, was officially joining the cast of The Last of Us as Abby. 
âOur casting process for season two has been identical to season one: we look for world-class actors who embody the souls of the characters in the source material,â Mazin and Druckmann said in a joint statement to Variety. âNothing matters more than talent, and weâre thrilled to have an acclaimed performer like Kaitlyn join Pedro, Bella and the rest of our family.â
Again, weâre not going to get into spoilers about Abby (though you can read about it in Polygonâs coverage of the game), but suffice it to say: HBOâs description of her as âa skilled soldier whose black-and-white view of the world is challenged as she seeks vengeance for those she lovedâ feels pretty apt. And Deverâs gonna have to get jacked.
Along with the casting of Dever as Abby, HBO has announced that Catherine OâHara, of Schittâs Creek, Beetlejuice, and general legendary character-actor fame, will join the cast in an undisclosed role. (Which means thereâs no word yet on whether her take on The Last of Us universe will include the softness of Nightmare Before Christmasâ Sally, or the exaggerated pronunciations of Schittâs Moira.) 
Also joining The Last of Us season 2: Isabela Merced as Dina and Young Mizuno as Jesse. Several more members of the cast were announced in March 2024, including Danny Ramirez (Top Gun: Maverick) as Manny, Ariela Barer (How to Blow Up a Pipeline) as Mel, Tati Gabrielle (You) as Nora, and Spencer Lord (Riverdale) as Owen. Most of this most recent batch of characters are key players in Abbyâs part of the story, though that means theyâll cross paths with Ellie eventually.

"Surviving the new Dune MMO sounds like hell, but at least you can drink the blood of your enemies","Dune: Awakening will pair survival and crafting mechanics with the social interaction of a massively multiplayer online game, letting players fulfill the hellish fantasy of surviving life on Arrakis. Yes, you can fly an ornithopter. Yes, you can use the Voice to bend the will of your enemies. And yes, you can drink the blood of your enemies in an effort to stay hydrated on Duneâs deadly desert planet.
On Monday, during the Dune: Awakening Direct livestream, Funcom chief creative officer Joel Bylos walked potential players through the scope of the survival MMO, detailing what they can (and canât) do in game. You canât kill a sandworm, and it doesnât sound like youâll be able to ride one â at launch, anyway.

    Related
  
Survival and crafting are unsurprisingly a major component of Dune: Awakening. Players will have to be mindful of dangers, like sandstorms, sandworms, exposure to Arrakisâ intense sunlight, and dehydration. To combat the latter, players will be able to explore Arrakisâ dew fields or eat plant fibers that contain trace amounts of water. In more desperate situations, players can shoot enemies and take their blood as a source of water.
Players will also scavenge for resources to craft their personal arsenal. Theyâll make their own stillsuit, forge steel, build bases, and construct machines as they advance through Dune: Awakeningâs technology tree. Players will get access to ornithopters, sand bikes, and thumpers â all helpful devices when trying to avoid the sandworms of Arrakis, a constantly looming threat.
Another threat? Other players. Dune: Awakening will take a combined-arms approach, letting players use melee, ranged weapons, special abilities, and vehicles to wage war against their opponents.
Dune: Awakening also promises âpolitical survival,â as players can align themselves with house Atreides or Harkonnen and rise through the ranks to achieve positions of power. âThe universe of Dune is a perfect place with these politics and intrigue,â Bylos said, noting that Funcomâs approach was âletâs get players hooked on the survival [gameplay] and then bring them into the political survival of the Dune universe.â Players will start their journey in Dune: Awakening as a survivor lost in the desert, but through mentorship and in-game contracts, may wind up as a high-ranking baron.
It sounds like there are less politically motivated career options as well. Players who want to live their life on Arrakis as a crafter or architect, selling blueprints of their elaborate custom bases can do that too.
Dune: Awakening is coming to PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X, but Funcom has not revealed a release window for the game.",https://www.polygon.com/24090204/dune-awakening-survival-game-2024,2024-03-04 18:40:00
The Dune soundtrack requires enough vinyl records to choke a sandworm,"Perhaps you saw Dune: Part 2 this weekend and now youâre wondering, how do I recreate the experience of IMAX speakers vibrating my cerebrospinal fluid? Or maybe you couldnât get tickets until the end of March, so you need an auditory appetizer ASAP. Whatever the case, if youâre deep into Dune, I recommend the killer vinyl records for both Dune: Part 1 and Part 2 that, when combined, span a whopping seven LPs.
Mondo released a gorgeous double LP of the official Dune: Part 1 score. This is the official Hans Zimmer experience, a breakneck tour from the halls of a fortress in Caladan to the empty sands of Arrakis. You can get a taste of it on Spotify! 

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
If you want to listen to Zimmerâs music, but at a more leisurely pace than the bite-sized tracks of a soundtrack, Mondo also produced a triple LP called the Dune Sketchbook. Across nine sprawling instrumental songs, the music of Hans Zimmer does its damndest to transform your living room into an air-tight container full of the spice melange.

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
Iâve had a chance to listen to both of these albums, and theyâre fantastic. If youâre a vinyl person, then youâll know what I mean when I say that it just feels right listening to these elaborate instrumentals on the same setup that I listen to my old classical music records. And for people who like vinyl, but donât buy into the mystical âwarmthâ of its sound, the sleeves themselves are beautiful â perfect for display.
Want to round out the Dune collection? Mutant just announced a double LP for Dune: Part 2. The set is similarly gorgeous, its abstract cover resembling Harkonnen fireworks. Inside the sleeve, fans will find liner notes by Hans Zimmer along with the filmâs director, Denis Villeneuve. 

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
The bad news: youâll have to wait to listen to this one, since the first pressing ships on May 24.

But for $699, you get the custom-designed Xbox Series X console, all SpongeBobbed out, with 1 TB of storage; an Xbox Wireless Controller decorated with the likenesses of Squidward, Gary, Mr. Krabs, and more; and a digital copy of fighting game Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2. Normally, an Xbox Series X with a controller and the Nick brawler would run you about $550, so youâd be paying a premium â but thatâs a relatively small surcharge when you could have SpongeBob gazing back at you from your home entertainment center.
Paramount Game Studios and GameMill released Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 in November. The Smash Bros.-like added a fresh batch of Nickelodeon favorites to the roster, including Squidward Tentacles, Jimmy Neutron, and the Angry Beavers. Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob SquarePants was added to the lineup as DLC in February.

"Theyâre finally making another Mass Effect board game, and no itâs not Risk","Modiphius Entertainment, the studio behind science-fiction-inspired tabletop games such as Dune: Adventures in the Imperium, Fallout: Factions, and the Homeworld TTRPG has leveled up. Its next offering is a cooperative, story-driven board game titled Mass Effect the Board Game - Priority: Hagalaz. Better still is the fact that itâs been built by acclaimed designer Eric Lang (Blood Rage, Life in Reterra) and Calvin Wong Tze Loon é»å­å« (Crazy Rich Asians).
Mass Effect the Board Game is set during the events of Mass Effect 3. First released in 2012, the multi-platform, best-selling title brought to a close the long and arduous journey of Commander Shepard and their crew. According to a news release, this 1-4 player story-driven board game begins on the Normandy and sees the players working together to fight back the Reapers. The final product will include 32 mm scale pre-assembled plastic miniatures of both a male and a female Shepard, as well as Liara, Tali, Wrex, and pan-galactic tridactyl heartthrob, Garrus.
From todayâs news release:
A branching, narrative campaign allows for multiple playthroughs with a different experience every time. Card-driven AI and evolving stories respond to your actions â your early choices influence later missions. Gather Shepardâs squad from a selection of teammates from the Mass Effect trilogy [...]. Customise and upgrade your squadâs abilities, equipment, and powers as they gain experience. Enhance them further by unlocking unique powers with optional loyalty missions.
The announcement makes no mention of a crowdfunding campaign. Instead, the final product will be distributed by Asmodee âlaterâ in 2024. No pricing information was announced. Fans can sign up for newsletter at the official website.

Anime Awards 2024 names Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 Anime of the Year,"Crunchyroll has announced the winners of the 2024 Anime Awards, the annual awards ceremony hosted in Japan to honor and celebrate the best shows, voice actors, animators, musicians, and creators of the past year. On Saturday, Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 took home this yearâs top prize for anime of the year.
The second season of the popular supernatural action anime saw director Shota Goshozono assume the reins over the series from Sunghoo Park, who departed from the series following the completion of the showâs first season. Produced by studio MAPPA, the anime follows the story of Yuji Itadori, a young man with keen supernatural abilities who accidentally becomes the vessel of a malevolent cursed spirit known as Sukuna. Though initially sentenced to death, Yuji is spared and taken under the wing of Satoru Gojo, a powerful Jujutsu sorcerer, who trains him to aid in the never-ending war between humans and curses.
Jujutsu Kaisen left a huge impression on discerning anime fans when it first premiered back in 2020, going on to earn a place on our list of the best anime of that year. The seriesâ second season proved to be just as impressive, if not more so, claiming the coveted top spot on our list of the best anime of 2023.
Despite amassing a total of 25 nominations, Chainsaw Man only took home two awards this year, with Jujutsu Kaisen claiming the lionâs share of the awards with a total of 9 wins. Suzume won best anime film, a win that is all the more notable for the fact that it was not nominated for best animated feature at this yearâs Academy Awards. One Piece took home the award for Best Continuing Series and Best Character for seriesâ protagonist Monkey D. Luffy, no doubt owed in part to the explosive unveiling of Luffyâs âGear 5â transformation in the climax of the animeâs 20th season.

Ms. Marvel star Iman Vellani has âbeen assuredâ by Marvel sheâll return to the MCU,"Ms. Marvel is one of the most charming projects to come out of the recent Marvel Cinematic Universe, and thatâs owed in large part to its lead actor. Iman Vellani brought breakout Marvel Comics superhero Kamala Khan to the small and big screen with megawatt charm. 
So when Polygon sat down with Vellani in advance of this Saturdayâs 2024 Crunchyroll Anime Awards, we had to know: Have the folks behind the MCU assured her that Ms. Marvel has a place in its future? 
âI have been assured,â she replied, and continued, with good humor, âSo that feels good, but there was no more assurance than that. [laugh] They give me breadcrumbs, and I try and make a meal out of it.â 
Vellaniâs last MCU project was The Marvels, which concluded with a big tease for a teenage superhero team featuring Vellaniâs Ms. Marvel, Hailee Steinfeldâs Hawkeye, and other teenage superheroes in Nick Furyâs database, like Kathryn Newtonâs Stinger. The scene is the closest Marvel Studios has come to confirming a production featuring the Young Avengers team, though many characters traditionally associated with the comic book version of the team have already appeared in the MCU at least once. 
Alternatively, now that Ms. Marvel is a known mutant character, Vellani might also be tapped for whatever Marvel Studios plans to do with the X-Men franchise. But with the companyâs output being significantly retooled in the wake of high profile firings and a string of poorly received projects, itâs also unclear when anything that incorporates the X-Men into the MCU would swim into focus. 
For now, at least, Vellani remains assured. ",https://www.polygon.com/24087888/iman-vellani-ms-marvel-young-avengers,2024-03-01 20:47:00
The Strangers remake already looks scarier than the original,"The original The Strangers movie is quietly one of the creepiest movies of the 2000s. So when the trilogy of new movies in the series was announced late last year, it was fair to be a little skeptical. But the new trailer for The Strangers: Chapter 1 was released on Friday and it already looks creepier than the original, so there might be a whole lot more scares left in this franchise. 
The trailer sets up what looks like a pretty straightforward remake of the original Strangers movie. A couple, played by Madelaine Petsch (Riverdale) and Froy Gutierrez (Teen Wolf), takes a vacation to a beautiful but remote cabin that gets targeted by a masked group of people who seem hell-bent on torturing them. Just like the first movie, the trailer is full of haunting images and cruel mysteries, like why this couple was targeted in the first place. But director Renny Harlin clearly has an experienced hand, pulling in confidently chilling shots like one of Petsch in the shower as a masked killer lurks behind her just out of view. 
While remaking a movie from 2008 may seem surprising, the real point of this project is what comes next: two sequels that will follow Petschâs character after the events of the first movie. According to Harlin the next two movies will explore her trauma and the difficulties of her life surviving such a harrowing home invasion. While this sounds like a fascinating project, one clear risk is that some of the tension of the first movie might be lost knowing someone survives. But, if this trailer is any indication, the journey between arriving at the cabin and escaping it should be creepy enough to more than make up for the spoiler implicit in the remakeâs Chapter 1 title. 
The Strangers: Chapter 1 will arrive in theaters on May 17. The original plan was for all three movies in the trilogy to be released this year, but after the Hollywood strikes last year, it seems that theyâre likely to get pushed in 2025 as well.

All the Dune 3 news weâve heard so far,"Dune: Part Two has only just arrived, but as anyone whoâs already seen the movie knows, thereâs certainly more story to tell on Arrakis. Thankfully, it seems like Part Two is already poised to be a box office hit, so hopefully a conclusion to the trilogy will be on the way soon.
While nothingâs official quite yet, hereâs everything we know so far about Dune 3, what it will be about, when it could come out, and whoâs coming back from the first two movies. 
[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for Dune: Part Two.]
Almost certainly. Warner Bros. seems very likely to want a third movie in the Dune series, considering how well Part Two is likely to do at the box office. Meanwhile, director Denis Villeneuve has been clear that heâs excited by the idea. In fact, heâs said that heâs already working on a script for the third movie and that if he likes it heâll make it. 
This is the biggest open question about Dune 3. Villeneuve has already said that he doesnât want to jump right back into the series. Heâd rather give it a break for a little bit and work on some other projects before returning to the desert. This means that Dune 3 is likely quite a few years away. At the absolute earliest, we could probably see Dune 3 in 2028, but it seems far more likely that weâll be waiting until closer to 2030 to see the end of this saga. 
According to Villeneuve, Dune 3 would likely follow the story of the book Dune Messiah pretty closely. Since Villeneuve split Frank Herbertâs original Dune novel into two parts, ending the trilogy by adapting the second book in the series would make sense. On top of that, Messiah is (mostly) the conclusion of Paul Atreidesâ story, which would also make it a fitting ending to the film series. 
With a cast this great, it seems like part of the draw of a third movie would be to reunite them. It even seems like Villeneuve is likely to age up Alia in his version of Messiah so that Anya Taylor-Joy could continue to play her in the next movie. 
This is complicated question because everyone is likely to head off in different directions between now and Dune 3. But hereâs a list of upcoming projects for some of Dune: Part Twoâs biggest players. 
TimothÃ©e Chalamet â The James Mangold (Logan) directed Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown, is likely to be Chalametâs next project.
Zendaya â Zendaya will be in Challengers just a few weeks after Dune on April 26, as well as Euphoriaâs next season, whenever that comes out. 
Denis Villeneuve â Itâs not exactly clear what Villeneuveâs next movie will be, but we know heâs attached to a movie about Cleopatra, so maybe itâs that. 
Josh Brolin â We donât know what Brolin will be in next just yet, but he does keep teasing an appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine. 
Javier Bardem â Bardem will next appear in the second season of the true crime series Monster, which will focus on the Mendendez brothers.
Rebecca Ferguson â Season 2 of Silo is likely the next time weâll see Rebecca Ferguson on screen. 
Florence Pugh â The next project we actually know about from Florence Pugh should be Marvelâs Thunderbolts, which just recently started filming. 
Austin Butler â Butler is in Masters of the Air on Apple TV right now, with the series finale airing a couple of weeks after Dune: Part Two premieres. Heâll also be in The Bikeriders, which is set to come out this year but doesnât have a firm release date just yet. 
Dave Bautista â Dave Bautista, as always, has a lot of irons in the fire, but it seems like the next one might be In the Lost Lands, a fantasy movie about a magical power that lets people turn into werewolves. 
Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd â SkarsgÃ¥rdâs next appearance is almost certainly the second season of Andor, which isnât due out until 2025.
Anya Taylor-Joy â Tayloy-Joy is heading straight back to the desert later this summer with Furiosa, the long-awaited prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road. 
Many people will tell you that these books are over-complicated, dense, and weird, and those people are right. But to me, thatâs a good thing and exactly why you should read them. 
At the very least, you should pick up Dune Messiah and give it a read. Itâs a great scifi book and a fascinating conclusion for Paulâs story. Plus youâve probably got like six years to do it, so no rush. ",https://www.polygon.com/24085898/dune-3-release-date-cast-news,2024-02-29 23:00:00
Pretty wild that this mini nuke replica is allowed to be mailed,"Bethesda has opened up pre-orders for an anthology of Fallout games, appropriately bundled into a decorative mini nuke you might fire off at a Deathclaw. The Fallout S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Anthology, a $60 collectorâs edition, will launch just before the April 12 premiere of the Fallout TV show on Prime Video. The set includes the Steam codes for every Fallout title launched on PC since 1997, plus a comprehensive set of DLC for many of the games included.
Youâre getting the definitive editions of Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and the original Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout: Tactics (this one isnât canon, but is still worth playing). The code for each game is printed on the back of a card corresponding to one of seven primary upgrade stats from the Fallout game series. This seems like a pretty thoughtful, yet cheeky way to honor the franchise.

              Prices taken at time of publishing.
            
The combined price of the Steam versions of every Fallout title included in this bundle is typically lands around $150. So, itâs a good deal, even when you consider that the original game is currently free for Amazon Prime subscribers (the sequel will join it in March).
While this latest Fallout collectorâs edition is a little light on loot, the acceptable price reflects that. Iâm sure Bethesda isnât looking to repeat the quagmire that was the Fallout 76 Power Armor Edition, which caused an uproar by those who felt its contents were falsely advertised. Bethesda eventually compensated people who purchased the $199.99 version of the game with replacement products and in-game currency.

"Post-credit scenes, sequel teases, and everything else you need to know about Dune 2","Dune: Part Two hits theaters this weekend, bringing with it giant sandworms, TimothÃ©e Chalamet in a stillsuit, and the return of desert power. The follow-up to Denis Villeneuveâs Dune, released in 2021, is shaping up to be the first great sci-fi blockbuster of 2024. 
Hereâs everything you might want to know by the time your butt hits the theater seat. 
âIn Dune: Part Two,â says our own Austen Goslin, âVilleneuve has matured as a filmmaker. The movie is no less impressive than his previous work, maybe even more impressive. But these moments of visual splendor often come and go with little fanfare, supporting the character and action of a scene rather than distracting from them. Villeneuve has never had this kind of overt visual confidence before. Itâs a clear statement that no single visual has to be the movieâs signature moment, because itâs surrounded by a thousand other beautiful, breathtaking images that somehow all feel perfectly aligned.â

Dune: Part Two has no extra scenes in the credits, so you can just sit back and enjoy that Hans Zimmer score. 
2021âs Dune ended with a secretly imperial army retaking Arakkis for the Harkonnens. Paul and his mother escaped the slaughter to find refuge among the native Fremen tribes â but if youâd like more detail than that, we have a full recap.

Many actors from the original are back, like TimothÃ©e Chalamet as Paul Atreides, Zendaya as Chani, Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica Atreides, Javier Bardem as Stilgar, Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, Dave Bautista as Glossu Rabban Harkonnen, Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Mohiam. (And yes, Zendaya is in more of this one.)
New to the cast are Oscar nominee Austin Butler (Elvis), who plays Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, the cruel and cunning nephew of Baron Harkonnen â and the equally Oscar-nominated Florence Pugh (Midsommar), who plays Princess Irulan Corrino, a Bene Gesserit adept and daughter of Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV. Oscar-winner Christopher Walken plays the Emperor himself. 
LÃ©a Seydoux (Crimes of the Future) plays the Bene Gesserit adept Lady Margot, and Anya Taylor-Joy (The Menu) also makes an appearance. 
A small cottage industry of âaccounts dedicated to lip-reading and people who claim to be experts in decoding body languageâ is making much hay out of the Chalamet, Zendaya, Pugh, and Butler press tour. But rumors of their animosity may be exaggerated.

The Terminator open-world survival game launches this fall,"Terminator: Survivors, a new open-world survival game set in the Terminator franchise, will launch in early access on Steam this fall, publisher Nacon announced Thursday at its Nacon Connect 2024 event.
Developer Nacon Milan did not reveal gameplay footage of Terminator: Survivors, but did offer some concept art for the game and ideas about what players can expect. The first-person shooter will be set in 2009, after the nuclear cataclysm brought about by Skynet and before the formation of John Connorâs resistance against the rogue AIâs machines. Terminator: Survivors will draw on the fiction of the first two Terminator films, its creators say.
According to Marco Ponte, CEO and creative director at Nacon Milan, Terminator: Survivors players will face âthe dangers of the post-apocalyptic world, and trying to cope with the threats posed by other human beings,â as well as threats from Skynetâs machines, including the iconic Terminator T-800. At first, Ponte said, survivors in the game world will be âunaware of the existence of Skynet and the Terminator,â but later will âjoin forces with other survivors and discover the truth about the ongoing conflict and begin to fight back.â Players will meet âfamous charactersâ from the Terminator franchise, in addition to new ones.

Terminator: Survivors will have base-management elements and first-person shooter mechanics, and can be played either solo or in co-op in groups of four. Based on the gameâs two trailers, encounters with Terminators are implied to be rare; so far, weâve seen just one T-800 hunting human prey, unlike the massive-scale human vs. Skynet battles shown in the Terminator movies (and in the recently released strategy game Terminator: Dark Fate â Defiance). But theyâll still be a threat. Skynetâs machines âwill hound you relentlessly, while other humans will be eyeing up the same resources as you,â Nacon said in a news release.
Terminator: Survivors will launch in early access on Steam for Windows PC on Oct. 24, just days before the 40th anniversary of the franchiseâs launch. The game will come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at a later date, the publisher said.
2024 has already been a big year for survival games, with the launches of Palworld, Enshrouded, and Nightingale. Hopefully, Terminator: Survivorsâ unique setting and terrifying enemy will help it stand out from the crowd.",https://www.polygon.com/24086601/terminator-survivors-survival-game-release-date-nacon,2024-02-29 18:30:00
"Kaiju No. 8 looks like one of the yearâs best anime, and we finally know its release date","Kaiju No. 8 is one of the most anticipated anime of the upcoming season and its latest trailer revealed a few exciting new things about the series. The teaser, which was released on Thursday, announced that the show will premiere on April 13, and revealed who will perform the opening and closing songs for the first season. 
The showâs opening title song will be performed by YUNGBLUD, and will be called âAbyss.â Meanwhile, the closing song will be performed by OneRepublic and is called âNobody.â This marks a fairly rare case where both the opening and closing songs of an anime will be performed by English-language artists, and if the preview is any indication, the songs themselves will be entirely in English as well. 
Episodes of Kaiju No. 8 will be streamable on Crunchyroll, which shouldnât come as much of a surprise. What might be a little more surprising is that episodes will also premiere on X (formerly Twitter) at the same time, making the show the first big anime to debut episodes on the social media platform. 
Kaiju No. 8 takes place in a world tormented by the appearance of massive kaiju intent on destroying humanity. The story follows a character named Kafka who gains the power to transform into one of these kaiju and starts fighting back to protect humanity, but not everyone understands that this mysterious new kaiju is actually on their side.

"Altered TCG kills it with kindness, shatters records on Kickstarter with nearly $7 million","Altered, the novel new trading card game from startup Equinox Studio, has broken records with its inaugural crowdfunding campaign. With nearly $7 million earned from nearly 15,000 backers, it becomes the single most-funded TCG ever run on Kickstarter. The new card game, which will enter a crowded marketplace alongside games like Magic: The Gathering and Disney Lorcana, is expected to release on Aug. 26, 2024.
âWe are overwhelmed by the incredible support and enthusiasm shown by our backers throughout this campaign,â said RÃ©gis BonnesÃ©e, founder and CEO of Equinox, in a news release. âThe success of our Kickstarter campaign not only validates our vision for Altered but also inspires us to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation in gaming. We are immensely grateful to each and every backer who has joined us on this journey.â

    Related
  
Game designer BonnesÃ©e, previously the founder of Libellud (Dixit, Mysterium, Seasons), offered a unique vision for a modern TCG, one that has clearly resonated with backers during the campaign. Games of Altered feature a novel back-and-forth mechanic that emphasizes bringing people together, not destroying their hitpoints. The game also offers a bright and inclusive art style that stands in stark contrast to other games with more grimdark themes. But its digital aspect is what has really turned heads.
Every card in Altered has a QR code that, when scanned, locks ownership of that card to a consumerâs digital account. Once acquired, additional copies of that card can be ordered at any time for a fee, opening up the game to the use of proxies on an almost industrial scale. Equinox will also offer a digital real-money global marketplace where digital rights to cards can be bought and sold, their ownership transferred without the physical cards themselves ever needing to change hands.

The success of the campaign is also good news for tabletop game publisher and distributor, Asmodee, which has partnered with Equinox for global sales and distribution. Recently purchased by Embracer on a valuation of more than $3.1 billion, Asmodee is among the largest global distributors of TCGs, including Magic: The Gathering. Itâs been one of the few bright spots on Embracerâs recent financial reports. In this way its financial situation closely mirrors that of Hasbro, whose books have been marginally stabilized by sales of Magic, a blockbuster 31-year-old TCG that seems more popular than ever. Meanwhile, and also like Embracer, Hasbro recently chose company-wide layoffs to help balance its books â just in time for the holidays.

One of D&Dâs greatest treasures will soon be shared with the world ,"When pop culture fandoms heat up, collectors begin to come out of the woodwork. Not speculators, mind you, like the pie-eyed, self-styled investor class that has glommed onto trading card games like Magic: The Gathering and Disney Lorcana. No, Iâm talking about real collectors in search of rare artifacts, often from early on in the history of a given fandom.
Fans of Dungeons & Dragons are no different in this regard. In fact, the market for rare D&D books and ephemera has been hot as hell going on a decade now. The original, TSR-published âbrown boxâ version of D&D? Even a busted-up old copy will run you close to $13,000 today on eBay. Some items are so obscure, so singular that their very existence is in question. Thatâs the case for the rare first draft of Dungeons & Dragons, which will be reproduced for the first time ever in a new book, The Making of Original Dungeons & Dragons: 1970-1977. Polygon sat with the project lead, senior game designer at Wizards of the Coast Jason Tondro, to learn more.
Tondro said that the book begins by telling the story of D&Dâs co-creators, Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax. It details how Gygax, with his focus on combat made clear after the publication of a game called Chainmail, was introduced to Arneson and an early version of his own game, a proto-RPG campaign called Blackmoor. After an initial playtest of Blackmoor in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, the pair began a correspondence.
âGygax writes to Arneson,â Tondro said, âand we reproduce this letter in the book, where he [tells] Arneson, âSend me everything you have on Blackmoor so I can write it up!â And Arneson does send him game notes for the Blackmoor campaign. But thatâs what they are, game notes. And so Gygax has to work this into a publishable manuscript, and he has to create a lot of new material. And so he sits down at his typewriter, and he types out a 50-page first draft of Dungeons & Dragons.â
The Making of Original Dungeons & Dragons, Tondro said, will include that first draft â all 50 pages â in its entirety. And it will also include the second draft, which may actually be the more interesting document.
âHe and Arneson make notes on it,â Tondro said, âand they expand it until itâs about 100 pages. We have that, and we reproduce that â in complete â for the first time ever. The first drafts of Dungeons & Dragons, written on Gygaxâs typewriter! So this is really the reason that this book exists.â
âVery few people alive today have ever even seen it, if they even know it exists,â Tondro said. But the documentâs story doesnât end there. âOnce that manuscript existed, it was kind of passed around. Gygax sent a copy to [Arneson], who then shopped it around the Twin Cities and his gaming group. People started making notes on it, and changes started to happen. Not all those changes got back to Gygax, so what you have is kind of variant versions of the first draft spreading out. And we reproduced a couple of those where they differ from the first draft.â
Throughout the nearly 600 pages of this book, the evolution of this early D&D manuscript will be interpreted by New York Times bestselling author and historian Jon Peterson, whose Game Wizards: The Epic Battle for Dungeons & Dragons remains the definitive modern history of the early years of D&D. That manuscript of that first draft, with its 50-page expansion making it into a second? Turns out itâs Petersonâs.
âJon has a one-in-a-million, world-class archive of these original documents,â Tondro said. âHe felt it was his responsibility to share it with the world. He came to us. This book was his idea. He said, âLook, weâve got this first draft of D&D. Your 50th anniversary is coming up. [...] The world needs to see it!â And he is right.â
But where did it come from? Polygon reached out to Peterson about the provenance of that document, which survives as a mimeographed copy of the hand-annotated original.
âNo commentâ is all he said.
The Making of Original Dungeons & Dragons: 1970-1977 arrives in stores on June 18 as a physical product. According to Wizards, no digital versions of any kind will be made. Pre-orders for the $99.95 hardcover book are now available.

How do you pronounce Balatro? We asked the developer,"During a recent Polygon meeting, I realized something: I have no idea how to pronounce Balatro, the name of developer LocalThunkâs incredible roguelite poker game thatâs occupied every one of my evenings since it was released. None of my colleagues knew the answer, either, so I did what any reporter would do. I sent an email to ask.
Balatro is not only the name of the game, but itâs also the Latin word for a professional jester or buffoon. (If you donât know about Balatro, which has grossed more than $1 million within mere hours of its release, hereâs a quick explanation: Youâre looking to make increasingly high scores by playing poker hands, improving your deck between each round by buying and upgrading cards. Joker cards can be purchased or unlocked to bend the rules of poker even further.) 

    Related
  
The easy answer for how to pronounce Balatro is by looking to the pronunciation of the Latin word, which is (/ËbÉËlÉËtroÊ/ BAH-lah-troh), according to Wikipedia. For reference, I have been pronouncing it ball-troh, because I didnât realize the Ace of Spades card in the logo stood in for an actual A. But when I did see the word spelled in regular text, I started calling it ball-uh-troh. There were a couple minor variations on the Latin pronunciation during the Polygon meeting where this question arose, including the correct Latin way.
But it turns out, weâre all right. A representative from PlayStack, the publisher of Balatro, said that there are three ways to look at this. 
The first is from the developer, LocalThunk, who said he doesnât actually know either â âwhatever makes people happy.â The second answer is the Latin pronunciation, which we already know is BAH-lah-troh. The third way, the representative said, comes from Latin teachers: âAs long as you pronounce it with confidence, it is correct!â
There you have it! Weâre all free to say Balatro in any way weâd like.",https://www.polygon.com/24086673/how-to-pronounce-balatro-card-game,2024-02-29 16:33:00
The first Discworld RPG in nearly three decades is on the way from ModiphiusÂ ,"Terry Pratchettâs hilarious Discworld series has been a fantasy mainstay in books, movies, and television for decades, even after the authorâs death in 2015. But for something thatâs so important to a popular genre, itâs odd that there havenât been many attempts to adapt it into a role-playing game, especially given its wealth of characters, species, settings, and deep satire. 
Modiphius Entertainment, publisher of licensed tabletop titles such as Dune: Adventures in the Imperium, announced on Thursday that it has officially licensed Discworld for a series of board games, along with a tabletop RPG called Terry Pratchettâs Discworld: Adventures in Ankh-Morpork. The latter will be the subject of a Kickstarter campaign, expected to launch later in 2024. 
âTerry had a lifelong affection with roleplaying games and itâs an entirely logical path along which you can follow his career from Dungeon Master to him becoming one of our most celebrated and beloved fantasy authors of all time,â said Rob Wilkins, Pratchettâs former assistant, in a press release on behalf of the authorâs estate. âWe are delighted to be partnering with Modiphius [â¦] we entirely trust them to get things right.â
No other details have been announced on the RPG, including what kind of rules it might use, but we can expect more details when the Kickstarter campaign launches.
The last official Discworld RPG was released in 1998 by Steve Jackson Games, with a GURPS-based rulebook written in part by Pratchett himself, along with Phil Masters, who has contributed to White Wolf games and worked on various GURPS supplements. A sequel, GURPS Discworld Also, was published in 2001. There have also been a few board games, including 2011âs Discworld: Ankh-Morpork, where players have to meet a set of conditions set by the personality they chose, then play cards to progress throughout the city.
The first gameâs fourth edition, published in 2016, is still available at Warehouse 23, Amazon, and DriveThruRPG in softcover or as a PDF. While you can get the hardcover edition at retailers like Noble Knight Games, itâll cost you around $225. According to Steve Jackson Games, the hardcover is out of print, so it could make for a nice collectorâs item.
Discworld adaptations have been hit-or-miss in terms of quality and fan response. There have been several BBC radio adaptations, but some of the movie and TV versions of Pratchett novels havenât been well received. One of the most recent was 2021âs The Watch , a BBC TV series that took the City Watch from books like Guards! Guards! and Men At Arms as inspiration, but deviated significantly from the source material. 
Modiphius has a history of working on faithful third-party adaptations, including the Fallout video game franchise in Fallout: Wasteland Warfare and Fallout: Factions, and the Homeworld RTS games with Homeworld: Revelations. Its latest release was Dune: Fall of Imperium, an expansion for Adventures in Imperium that puts you right in the middle of the fall of the House of Atreides. The publisher has also released its own original games, including Achtung! Cthulhu. Many of its past products have remained faithful to the properties theyâre based on, so we can probably expect the games to use a lot from the Discworld books. 
However, if you want to provide feedback for the publisher and make sure your favorite characters are included in the release, you can fill out this survey.

While it was first published in 1998, you can still get a version of the Discworld GURPS RPG as a PDF or softcover. The hardcover edition is available, but itâll put a strain on your wallet.

This board game came out over a decade ago, so itâs quite expensive if you want to buy a copy now. For $300, you can get a fun experience wherein you and your friends take on a personality from the Discworld universe and complete goals to win.

Electronic Arts cuts jobs for more than 670 workers,"Electronic Arts is laying off 5% of its workforce, or around 670 of the companyâs workers. EA employed around 13,400 people by the end of last March, according to a regulatory filing. Sixty-five percent of those employees are located outside the U.S., it said at the time. Notifying impacted employees âhas already begun and will be largely completed by early next quarter,â EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a note to staff published Wednesday.
Wilson also said EA is âmoving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.â Instead, itâll focus on âowned IP, sports, and massive online communities.â 
âWe are also leading through an accelerating industry transformation where player needs and motivations have changed significantly,â Wilson wrote. âFans are increasingly engaging with the largest IP, and looking to us for broader experiences where they can play, watch, create content, and forge deeper connections. Our industry exists at the cutting edge of entertainment, and in todayâs dynamic environment, we are advancing the way we work and continuing to evolve our business.â
No specific games were mentioned in Wilsonâs note, although EA is currently developing several games based on licensed properties, like a reported third Star Wars Jedi game, along with Marvelâs Black Panther and Iron Man. EA announced in 2022 that Respawn was developing three separate Star Wars games, one of which was Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Of the unannounced games, a first-person action title has been canceled. âAs weâve looked at Respawnâs portfolio over the last few months, whatâs clear is the games our players are most excited about are Jedi and Respawnâs rich library of owned brands,â EA entertainment and technology president Laura Miele said in a message to staff.

    Related
  
Miele also said that EA is âwinding down Ridgeline as a standalone studio in Seattle,â and that some staff there will join Ripple Effect to build âthe next Battlefield experience.â Ridgeline was spun up in 2022, led by Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto, to work on narrative Battlefield games. Lehto left EA and Ridgeline âon [his] own accordâ one day before EA announced the layoffs, he posted to X (formerly Twitter).
The cuts come almost one year after EA laid off around 700 people, or 6% of its staff, in March 2023. Earlier in February of this year, The company also laid off âa small number of staffâ earlier this week as it ceased operations on EA Sports MLB Tap Sports and F1 Mobile Racing. (These layoffs may be included in the 670 number announced Wednesday.) Those games are presumably part of the companyâs plan to âsunsetâ several games, as Wilson noted in the letter to staff.  The other mobile games that EA is sunsetting are Kim Kardashian Hollywood (announced earlier this year) and Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth. Miele reiterated, though, that mobile âcontinues to be the largest gaming platformâ with âstrong growth opportunities for EA.â
EA expects to spend $125 million to $165 million on these layoffs and other cost-cutting measures. Office space reductions will cost roughly $50 million to $60 million, while $35 million to $45 million is expected to go toward âcosts associated with licensor commitments,â according to a securities document filed Wednesday. EA said itâll spend $40 to $55 million on employee severance, which is on top of the $170 million to $200 million EA spent last year on its reorganization cost-cutting plan. (EA, at that time last year, expected to finish the actions related to those costs by Sept. 30, 2023. This time around, it expects to be finished by Dec. 31, 2024.) 
In late January, EA released its recent financial results where it reported earning $7.6 billion in the past 12 months before Dec. 31, 2023. Of that, EA made $5.8 billion in gross profit. EA reported that its net bookings are up by 1% year-over-year â part of that is related to its live service success, where it earned a ârecord $1.712 billion,â 3% more than last year. âOn a trailing twelve-month basis, live services were 73% of our business,â EA wrote. In particular, EA called out EA Sports FC for âoutperforming expectations.â
âI understand this will create uncertainty and be challenging for many who have worked with such dedication and passion and have made important contributions to our company,â Wilson said in the letter, adding that the company will do its best to help affected workers find ânew roles or paths to transition to other projects.â âWhile not every team will be impacted, this is the hardest part of these changes, and we have deeply considered every option to try and limit impacts to our teams.â
EA is, unfortunately, not alone in the worrying trend of increasing video game industry layoffs. On Tuesday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it was laying off 900 people, or 8% of staff. Insomniac Games, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla Games, and Sonyâs Technology, Creative, and Support divisions were all impacted. This week alone, people have been laid off from studios like Deck Nine Games, Supermassive Games, and esports company ESL; there was also a production halt at Die Gute Fabrik as funding ran dry.
Roughly 8,000 people have been laid off in the first two months of the year in a worrying trend thatâs quickly outpacing 2023, where around 11,000 people were laid off, per industry trackers. Why are these layoffs happening? A comedown after the pandemic is part of it, but not the whole story that includes increasing interest rates on loans, how expensive it is to make games, and a shift in video game industry business models. One important failure to consider is that executive leadership expected the engagement built during the pandemic to continue and grow; executives expanded their companies recklessly without a realistic long-term plan.

"Critical Roleâs next game, Daggerheart, will be available to download for free","Free stuff alert! Daggerheart, the forthcoming high fantasy tabletop role-playing game from Critical Roleâs publishing arm Darrington Press, will be available to download for free from March 12 as part of a public open beta playtest.
Playtesters over 18 years of age are invited to âdig into the game, have fun, pick it apart, and share honest and open feedbackâ with the developers, led by designer Spenser Starke. Daggerheart is set for a full, proper release in 2025. Starke says new versions of the game will be released throughout the development process as feedback is taken on board.
Playtest packets will be available to download from DriveThruRPG as well as the Daggerheart website from March 12. Thereâll also be a digital playtest of a character creation tool on Demiplane, plus some in-person playtesting at some local game stores belonging to the Darrington Press Guild, if youâre lucky enough to live near one of those.
On the day of the betaâs release, the Critical Role cast will be playing Daggerheart live starting at 7 p.m. PDT / 10 p.m. EDT on the Critical Role Twitch and YouTube channels. Thereâll also be helpful explainer videos uploaded to YouTube.
Daggerheart is a classical fantasy RPG; its standout features are a dice-roll system using twin 12-sided dice symbolizing âhopeâ and âfear,â and a card-based system for defining and developing your character through their Ancestry and Community as well as Subclass and Domain. After a demo at Gen Con, Polygon found the game cleverly designed for familiarity and accessibility to Dungeons & Dragons players, but perhaps lacking some of its own personality. Come March 12, youâll have an opportunity to assess it for yourself.

I Saw the TV Glow already looks like one of the best horror movies of the year,"Between movies like Dune: Part Two, Longlegs, Furiosa, Horizon, and Twisters, itâs already shaping up to be a pretty big year for movies. But even with all those big titles on the way, I Saw the TV Glow might still be the most exciting release of the year. The new horror movie from director Jane Schoenbrun got its first trailer on Wednesday, and it looks incredible. 
The trailer introduces us to Owen (Justice Smith) and his friend Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine) and their shared love of a TV show. But after the show is canceled, the lines of their reality start to blur as everything slips closer to the TV showâs world than their own. 
I Saw the TV Glow doesnât quite look like any other movie coming out in 2024. Itâs drenched in quietly creepy neon lights and filled with bizarre images that sit delicately on the line between recognizable reality and the world of its in-universe TV show. And thatâs just in the trailer. 
But all of this excellent atmosphere shouldnât be too surprising if youâve seen Schoebrunâs last movie, Weâre All Going to the Worldâs Fair, a tiny indie movie shot mostly on webcams that is one of the best and most unnerving horror movies of the last several years. 
I Saw the TV Glow premiered at the Sundance Film Festival this year and is set to arrive in theaters on May 3. ",https://www.polygon.com/24085704/i-saw-the-tv-glow-release-date-trailer-horror-movie-a24,2024-02-28 18:05:08
You can play Call of Duty: Warzone on your phone in March,"Activision Blizzard has a release date for its upcoming mobile version of Call of Duty: Warzone â March 21. The game has been in limited release since last year, but itâs finally ready for its official debut on Android and iOS devices, the company said in a post on its website.
Two maps, Verdansk and Rebirth Island, will be the âlarge-scaleâ options available at launch, with other multiplayer maps also there, like Shipment and Shoot House. The company said thereâs shared progression with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Call of Duty: Warzone that extends to player level, weapon level, battle pass progression, bundles, and your friends list.
Activision Blizzard said 50 million people have pre-registered for the mobile game, and you still sign up via its respective App Store and Play Store pages. 
Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile will have some different modes to play at launch. Hereâs how Activision Blizzard describes them:
Verdansk (Battle Royale, 120 players)
Since the destruction of Verdansk, the debut map for Call of Duty: Warzone, players have been eager to get back to the city where it all started.
This metropolis features a multitude of areas to explore and scour for loot, and with match support for up to 120 players, the battles are bound to be both furious and frequent. Will you drop in hot to a high-traffic point of interest like Superstore, gunning for an early advantage, or take a stealthier approach, playing at the edges of the circle collapse?
Get wiped? No problem. Fight for a second chance in the original Verdansk Gulag, where eliminated Operators battle for the privilege of redeploying to the match. Win and return to the fight.
Rebirth Island (Resurgence, 48 players)
Rebirth Island changed the Battle Royale experience when first released, offering a smaller map size catering to non-stop action. Battle within the central prison complex or traverse along the outer edges of the island, moving from building to building or taking your chances with longshots out in the open.
Matches here use Resurgence rules whereby players can respawn so long as one of their teammates is still alive on the map, skipping the Gulag in favor of getting back into the action as rapidly as possible.
Multiplayer: Fine-tune Your Tactics
Low on time and looking to get straight into the action? Eager to level up a new weapon? Wanting a quick warm up before dropping into a big map? Though Battle Royale is the main focus of Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, Multiplayer support lets players experience classic Call of Duty action across several Multiplayer maps and modes, including â but not limited to â Shipment, Shoot House, and Scrapyard. Deploy across a suite of classic modes like Team Deathmatch, Domination, Kill Confirmed and Search & Destroy, including Hardcore variants.
Activision Blizzard expects more updates and content for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile regularly.",https://www.polygon.com/24085672/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-release-date-announcement,2024-02-28 18:00:00
"Sifu, Destiny 2: The Witch Queen headline March PS Plus games","Four new games will be added to Sony Interactive Entertainmentâs PlayStation Plus lineup come March 5: EA Sports F1 23, Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, Sifu, and Hello Neighbor 2. All four games will be available to PS Plus subscribers from March 5 to April 1.
Sifu and Destiny 2: The Witch Queen are the top offerings this month. Sifu is a beat-âem-up kung fu game about a man looking for revenge for his fatherâs death. It takes some elements of roguelite games, allowing the player to rise again after death â continuing to fight as their character keeps aging. Meanwhile, Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is a recent expansion for Bungieâs shooter Destiny 2. Destiny 2 is free-to-play, but the expansion typically costs around $30.
EA Sports F1 23 is the official Formula One video game that lets players race on the sportâs most important tracks. Thereâs a story mode, a career mode where you can build your own team, and multiplayer. Hello Neighbor 2 from developer Eerie Guest and tinyBuild puts the player into the shoes of an investigative journalist looking to puzzle together clues from crime scenes.
All four games are available to play on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
Lastly, PS Plus subscribers will also get access to a cosmetics bundle for The Finals, a free-to-play first-person shooter thatâs styled as a game show. The bundle comes with two outfits and 12 weapon skins, according to Sony.
There are still a few days left before the February games are replaced with Marchâs â so if youâd like to play Foamstars, Rollerdrome, or Steelrising, head over to the PS Plus library to download them before March 4. Once you download a game as part of PS Plus, you wonât lose it once the month is over, only if you stop your PS Plus subscription.
PlayStation Plus has three different subscription tiers: PlayStation Plus Essential for $79.99 a year, PlayStation Plus Extra for $134.99 a year, and PlayStation Plus Premium for $159.99 a year. (Each tier also has per month and three month options.) ",https://www.polygon.com/24085769/march-playstation-plus-2024-free-games-sifu-destiny-2-witch-queen,2024-02-28 17:28:10
Blood Rage designer Eric Langâs next effort is the family friendly Life in Reterra,"Award-winning board game designer Eric Lang, whose Viking-themed Blood Rage is a fixture on Polygonâs list of the best modern board games, has something new to share â a tile-laying strategy game called Life in Reterra. This time, instead of partnering with hot young publishers like CMON or Steamforged Games, he and co-designer Ken Gruhl (Happy Salmon) have gone with the granddaddy of them all, 100-year-old Hasbro. And while we donât know everything yet about how the game works, we do know Lang himself considers it among his âstrongest designs ever,â and thatâs enough right there to get me interested.
A news release from Hasbro describes Life in Reterra as a cozy take on the post-apocalypse where humanity soldiers on after the end of civilization. The art supports that, with charming little cows and grainy wooden meeples. Itâs a Euro-style game, meaning that it likely avoids putting players into direct conflict and de-emphasizes the random nature of dice rolls. 
It clearly takes its cues from modern classics like Carcassonne and Kingdomino, which both ask players to build things out of shared piles of communal tiles. Itâs a genre of board gaming thatâs stood the test of time, mainly because theyâre quick to learn and hard to master â just the thing to hook new players. In a post on Facebook, Lang seems to agree. He calls the $29.99 title a âlifestyle gatewayâ â thatâs marketing speak for a game that can introduce casual consumers to more complex experiences. But he also touts its replayability, claiming âthousands of setups [that] all feel different.â
âWeâve been working on this game for years,â Lang said in the Facebook note. â I consider this among my strongest designs ever.â
Weâll know more once the early copies begin to make their way out to eager reviewers. You can find Life in Reterra available for pre-order starting today online at Target.

Call of Duty Black Ops designer starts new studio to create a more âintimateâ shooter,"David Vonderhaar left Call of Duty Black Ops developer Treyarch last August, after 18 years at the studio where he served as designer on eight Call of Duty games. On Wednesday, Vonderhaar announced a new venture and a new studio called BulletFarm.
BulletFarm is developing a ânew and ambitious AAA game, built in Unreal Engine 5 and set in an original universe with an emphasis on co-operative gameplay,â according to a news release. BulletFarm and parent company NetEase Games say the new studioâs untitled project will be a âmore intimate and relatable experience while offering a fresh take on first-person gameplay.â
Vonderhaar says heâs working âout of [his] comfort zoneâ with BulletFarmâs debut project.
âThis is a departure from the games Iâve worked on, but one that showcases my passion for rich characters, precise mechanics, more intimate storytelling, and plenty of action,â said Vonderhaar, studio head at BulletFarm, in a statement. âNetEase has provided us an incredible support structure to explore these new avenues and allow true freedom to begin building the concept and ideas for our game.â
Thus far, BulletFarm has released two pieces of artwork that appear to be related to its new project. The one below offers a light retro â90s aesthetic, with its CRT television and vintage covers for Thrasher, Raygun, and i-D magazines on the wall.
Joining Vonderhaar at BulletFarm is game designer Chris Cowell, who also has 18 years of experience working on Call of Duty. Cowell will serve as the new studioâs creative director.
BulletFarm is headquartered in Los Angeles but is described as having a âremote-first approach.â The studio is actively hiring, a welcome contrast to industry-wide news of mass layoffs in 2024.
Vonderhaar and Cowell were most recently credited on 2020âs Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. This yearâs Call of Duty entry is being led by Treyarch, and is reportedly a sequel to Cold War set in the â90s Gulf War era.
BulletFarm and NetEase did not announce a release window or platforms for their new game.
Treyarch and Cowellâs departures from Treyarch is part of a larger trend of studio leadership and senior designers exiting the Call of Duty studio. In 2021, longtime Treyarch developers Dave Anthony and Jason Blundell announced a new studio, Deviation Games, which is partnering with Sony Interactive Entertainment to develop a new franchise for PlayStation Studios. In 2022, veteran Treyarch co-head Dan Bunting left the studio in the wake of a Wall Street Journal investigation into a sexual harassment claim made against him.",https://www.polygon.com/24084622/call-of-duty-black-ops-david-vonderhaar-bulletfarm-games,2024-02-28 13:00:00
PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket devs say itâs not an NFT project,"The PokÃ©mon Company revealed a new virtual card collecting game called PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket on Tuesday. After the reveal, fans online expressed concern that the game would contain non fungible tokens (NFTs). However, it now looks like NFTs wonât play any part in the new game. In a statement issued to Polygon, a representative of the PokÃ©mon Company said it has ânot developed or approvedâ any PokÃ©mon NFTs. 
PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket is a new game from the PokÃ©mon Company, Creatures Inc., and DeNA, the developers of PokÃ©mon Masters EX. We only got a first trailer on Monday, but itâs already clear the game will heavily emphasize digital card collecting. Because of this, fans wondered if these digital card collectibles could be sold as NFTs. One person called the new game an âNFT scamâ and another said that the developers made âPokÃ©mon NFTs in 2024.â
Polygon reached out to the PokÃ©mon Company to seek clarification of the development teamâs plans. In response, a representative told Polygon that the company  âhas not developed or approved of Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) related to the PokÃ©mon brand and associated intellectual propertyâ and that any NFTs being sold with PokÃ©monâs intellectual property âare unofficial and in no way affiliated with The PokÃ©mon Company International or the PokÃ©mon brand.â 
You can read the full statement below: 
The PokÃ©mon Company International has not developed or approved of Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) related to the PokÃ©mon brand and associated intellectual property. Fans should be aware that any NFTs in the marketplace featuring PokÃ©mon intellectual property are unofficial and in no way affiliated with The PokÃ©mon Company International or the PokÃ©mon brand.
The idea of NFTs in a PokÃ©mon game is an odd one. Sure, plenty of game companies have tried to find ways to incorporate NFTs into games and invested in the technology, but overall NFTs in games have been a bust. Fans of video games have rejected NFTs, and the broader crypto market that propped up NFTs also crashed. On top of all of that, NFTsâ need for blockchain technology would provide logistical challenges to development and seems like a mismatched fit for a family-friendly brand like PokÃ©mon.
Also, in the end, itâs just unnecessary. Video game developers donât need NFTs to create valuable and limited virtual items â just look at how much people will spend on cosmetics in any live-service game. The developers have not revealed many details of the monetization model for this game, but we know that Pocket will be a free-to-play game and players can open âtwo booster packs every day at no cost,â the release said. 
My personal guess is that Pocket will have in-game purchases where people can buy more packs of cards to try and get a coveted card, just like fans do IRL. And just like in real life, people might be willing to spend exorbitant amounts to get the sparkling cards of their favorite PokÃ©mon.",https://www.polygon.com/24085172/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-tcg-nft,2024-02-28 10:41:31
Nintendo suing makers of open-source Switch emulator Yuzu,"Nintendo is suing the makers of Yuzu, an open-source Nintendo Switch emulator, according to a lawsuit filed in Rhode Island court on Monday. Game File reporter Stephen Totilo first reported the suit.
The 41-page lawsuit was filed against Tropic Haze, the company that makes Yuzu. (Nintendo also specifically references a person aliased as Bunnei, who leads development on Yuzu.) Yuzu is a free emulator that was released in 2018 months after the Nintendo Switch originally launched. The same folks who made Citra, a Nintendo 3DS emulator, made this one. Basically, itâs a piece of software that lets people play Nintendo Switch games on Windows PC, Linux, and Android devices. (It also runs on Steam Deck, which Valve showed â then wiped â in a Steam Deck video clip.) Emulators arenât necessarily illegal, but pirating games to play on them is. But Nintendo said in its lawsuit that thereâs no legal way to use Yuzu.
Nintendo argued that Yuzu executes codes that âdefeatâ Nintendoâs security measures, including decryption using âan illegally-obtained copy of prod.keys.â 
âIn other words, without Yuzuâs decryption of Nintendoâs encryption, unauthorized copies of games could not be played on PCs or Android devices,â Nintendo wrote in the lawsuit. As to the alleged damages created by Yuzu, Nintendo pointed to the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Tears of the Kingdom leaked almost two weeks earlier than the gameâs May 12 release date. The pirated version of the game spread quickly; Nintendo said it was downloaded more than 1 million times before Tears of the Kingdomâs release date. People used Yuzu to play the game; Nintendo said more than 20% of download links pointed people to Yuzu.
Though Yuzu doesnât give out pirated copies of games, Nintendo repeatedly said that most ROM sites point people toward Yuzu to play whatever games theyâve downloaded.
Nintendo said its âexpended significant resources to stop the illegal copying, marketing, sale, and distributionâ of its Nintendo Switch games. It says that Yuzu earns the team $30,000 per month on its Patreon from more than 7,000 patrons. Nintendo said the company has earned at least $50,000 in paid Yuzu downloads. Nintendo said that Yuzuâs Patreon doubled its paid members in the period between May 1 and May 12, when Tears of the Kingdom was released.
Nintendo is asking the court to shut down the emulator, and for damages. Polygon has reached out to Nintendo and Tropic Haze for comment.
The Tears of the Kingdom publisher is notoriously strict with its intellectual property. Nintendoâs won several lawsuits targeting pirated game sites like RomUniverse, where it was awarded more than $2 million in damages. Nintendo also notoriously went after an alleged Nintendo Switch hacker named Gary Bowser, who was arrested and charged for selling Switch hacks. Though heâs been released from prison, Bowser still owes Nintendo $10 million; he paid Nintendo $175 while in prison from money he earned working in the prison library and kitchen.",https://www.polygon.com/24085140/nintendo-totk-leaked-yuzu-lawsuit-emulator,2024-02-27 23:04:14
The Halo TV seriesâ new clip has an unarmored Master Chief face down a Brute,"The Halo TV seriesâ previous episode left off with Reach under siege, and with Master Chief and the rest of the Spartans doing their best to protect whatâs left of the planet. But based on Polygonâs exclusive new clip from episode 5, Chief and his team arenât out of hot water yet.
The clip from the episode, which debuts on Thursday, shows John (Pablo Schreiber), along with a few other Spartans including Soren (Bokeem Woodbine), taking aim down a long quiet hallway. None of the Spartans have armor on, since the UNSC neglected to give it back to them before the Covenant invaded Reach, giving the whole thing an extra air of danger. All of the sudden, the threat reveals itself, as a massive Brute bursts through the ceiling wielding a gravity hammer. 
This isnât the first time weâve seen Brutes in the Halo series. Most notably, they popped up in the final episode of season 1, but they didnât get to shine as much as fans of the game might have hoped. This time time around, however, with all of the Spartans out of their armor, it seems like this Brute could put up quite a fight for Chief and his allies. 
This clip comes from Halo season 2âs fifth episode. There are just three more before the eight-episode season is finished. ",https://www.polygon.com/24084060/halo-tv-series-master-chief-brute-fight-season-2-episode-5,2024-02-27 19:00:00
PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket makes perfect sense,"It hasnât always been easy to get PokÃ©mon card packs over the past several years. During the pandemic, PokÃ©mon cards saw a massive surge in popularity, so big that the PokÃ©mon Company had to take drastic measures, producing more than 9 billion cards over the course of a single year as a way to address the shortage. Itâs unclear what caused the boom, but itâs likely a mix of people picking up new (or old) pandemic hobbies and the increase of content creators buying cards and opening packs on streams. Basically, PokÃ©mon cards became a nostalgia-fueled way to gamble.
YouTube creators and Twitch streamers started buying up packs to open on stream, and the viewers were there. To get a sense of how popular PokÃ©mon pack opening was on Twitch during the pandemic, we can look toward Twitch Metrics, a third-party site that tracks Twitch data. From March 2020 to January 2021, PokÃ©mon card unboxing grew by 3,000% in monthly viewership. One streamer, Luxury Ball Collectibles, spent six hours opening PokÃ©mon card packs a few years ago. Another YouTuber, Deep Pocket Monster, frequently racks up hundreds of thousands of views. These sorts of videos are alluring because theyâve got big personalities, suspense, and drama. Viewers get all the adrenaline of gambling and pulling out that rare card without any of the risk.

Thatâs why the upcoming PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket, announced Tuesday during the PokÃ©mon Presents PokÃ©mon Day broadcast, makes perfect sense: Itâs a way to mimic the experience of watching someone open a card on stream â but better, since youâre directly involved. And with two free packs per day, thereâs still that mitigated risk (unless you purchase more, of course). The PokÃ©mon Company is working with Creatures Inc., which makes physical cards, and DeNA, the studio behind PokÃ©mon Masters EX, to release the app on Android and iOS sometime in 2024.
Though you can take part in short, simple battles, PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket appears to be centered more on the act of opening, collecting, and trading cards. The trailer shows the highs and lows of a personâs experience opening packs, relishing the satisfying zip of tearing one open. The person in the PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket trailer gets a notification ping on his phone when his pack comes in, before using his finger to swipe it open and start flipping through cards with a Tinder-esque swipe (no rejections here, though). Because these cards are digital, PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket can make cards âimmersive,â according to the developers, letting players explore the art of some cards in a 3D space. Because you likely wonât be able to sell these cards, it feels like these immersive cards replace that resale value, adding to the experience of collecting.
PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket is âfree-to-start,â according to the PokÃ©mon Company. Presumably, besides the two free packs a day, there will be options to purchase more. (The PokÃ©mon Company hasnât detailed any pricing information just yet.) Certainly, there will be tons of people willing to spend lots of money on digital cards, but the two free packs will be enough of a thrill for lots of people â a little burst of that feeling from watching a card opening stream, but even better because you get to keep the cards, even if thereâs no sell value. (We donât know if youâll be able to sell cards, but it feels unlikely!)
So while the viewership numbers for PokÃ©mon card content creators have decreased since the pandemic, interest remains strong â and the PokÃ©mon Company certainly wants to capitalize on that. PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket looks like a great way to do that, although weâll have to see what else the app has in store.",https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/24084660/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-twitch-streams,2024-02-27 17:15:00
Willem DaFoeâs video tour of his Poor Things house is full of wild details,"Yorgos Lanthimosâ dark comedy Poor Things, releasing on digital platforms on Tuesday, is in the running for 11 Oscars â and while itâs up for the big ones, like Best Director and Best Motion Picture, itâs no surprise that it got nods in the design categories as well. One of 2023âs most deliriously lavish, visually over-the-top movies, Poor Things puts its female Frankenstein figure Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) in puffy sleeves bigger than her head, surrounds her with stitched-together duck-and-dog hybrid creatures, and situates her in a house that feels like a creepy design wonderland.
In an exclusive clip from a featurette on the Blu-ray and DVD release, provided to Polygon by Searchlight Pictures, Poor Things co-star Willem DaFoe walks us through that house and points out some of the weirder details. At the same time, the designers discuss their influences and intentions in assembling the place.
The neatest detail in this video is the incredibly detailed 3D flythrough graphic, which shows what kind of previsualization imaging went into building this multi-story, multi-room set. In both the tour and the flythrough, every inch of available surface is crammed with paintings, fabric bas-relief sculpting, momentos, decorations, and occult or weird-science knickknacks. Check out that two-headed fetal skeleton, or the pancreas-shaped alchemical retort that doubles as an external pancreas for DaFoeâs character, mad scientist Godwin Baxter.
The best details on the house tour are undoubtedly the anatomical ones. DaFoe points out the secret door, and Stone points out the fish-lamps and seaweed designs sewn into Bellaâs walls, but the real star of the show is the ceiling composed of two intertwined earlobes, and the makeup mirror with prominent ears on it is a fun touch, too. Then there are the details meant to evoke either an operating theater (the coiled fetus sculpture wrapped in a womb and given a prominent display place in the dining room) or a mental institution (the padded floors throughout the house). It all blends in a pretty creepy way with the âVictorian childrenâs playroom, but for grown-upsâ theme of Bellaâs bedroom.
Poor Things will be available for digital purchase on Feb. 27, and it releases on Blu-ray and DVD on March 12. Weâll ",https://www.polygon.com/24083883/willem-dafoe-poor-things-video-tour-set-design,2024-02-27 16:32:00
Our Brilliant Ruin explores the sickly crust of aristocracy left clinging to the edge of the world,"On a planet that is not our own, in a timeline very different from ours, the last heirs of aristocracy cling to the shadows of a secluded mountain valley known as the Dramark. Itâs only deep within the valley that a tiny, proud crust of civilization can be kept hidden from the Ruin (thatâs what people call the light of the dying star that has been changing the countryside and its people for generations, turning them into monsters). Meanwhile, long-dead mechanical constructs called syllokinetics, automatons that were to be the peopleâs saviors, sit and wither on the horizon. Elsewhere, the Dramarkâs lavish estates and their downstairs staff carry on as best they can.
This is the Edwardian-inspired setting for Our Brilliant Ruin, a grim yet gilded new world dreamed up by the small, talented team at Studio Hermitage. Starting Tuesday their vision begins to come to life, first as a tabletop role-playing game and, if its founders are lucky, hopefully as something more â like a comic book or even a video game. At its core is a desperate class struggle, one that could set this world apart from a vast sea of fantasy and science fiction competitors.
Studio Hermitage is a transmedia company founded just a few years ago by Paxton Galvanek, Justin Achilli, and Andy Foltz, all with backgrounds in making video games for companies like Funcom, Ubisoft, and Red Storm. But itâs Achilliâs name that will likely perk up the ears of tabletop fans, since heâs had a hand in the World of Darkness, home to games like Vampire: The Masquerade, for nearly 30 years. His enthusiasm for Our Brilliant Ruin is infectious, and the setting â originally pitched as a post-apocalyptic take on Downton Abbey â appears to be worthy of attention. Its inciting event is the arrival of the Ruin, a dead star with light that causes devastation wherever it touches.
âThis light interacts very, very strangely with our planet,â Achilli said. âItâs corrosive. Itâs poisonous in and of itself. So itâs eating away at the substance of the world, [and] itâs affecting people very strangely.â
When people pass away while illuminated by the Ruin, for instance, their last emotional state is captured as a kind of photostatic image. âThatâs where ghosts come from,â Achilli said â and vampires, too. âHereâs this awful, awful new natural law that we canât do anything about, but we have to live in its aftermath.â
Itâs in that aftermath that Our Brilliant Ruinâs epic struggles will play out, not as battles between warring wizards or high-tech hackers but as violent struggles between starkly divided, nearly feudal classes just trying to survive. There are the Aristocrats, not unlike Lord and Lady Crawley in Downton Abbey, who own the land and enforce what few laws remain. Below them are the Truefolk, skilled laborers and artisans who make up what passes for the middle class.
âThey are the downstairs in the upstairs-downstairs drama,â explains writer and designer Rachel J. Wilkinson. âTheyâre your shopkeepers, your couriers, your carriage drivers. Theyâre your investigators. [...] They are sort of keeping the trains going on time, and what they have done is they have sacrificed a level of agency for comfort.â
Below them all are the Unbonded â Our Brilliant Ruinâs homesteaders and pioneers, some of whom may have even more powerful knowledge secreted away about the syllokinetics looming on the horizon.
âThe idea is that the group [of players] will start out either with an estate or very quickly come to possess an estate,â Achilli explained. âLetâs say Iâm an Aristocrat, and youâre a Truefolk, and Rachelâs Unbonded. The estate is mine, and I need someone to work on the estate. So your character concept can potentially fit in there. You might be a butler, or you might be any one of the other guilds of the Truefolk. [...] Rachel, as the Unbounded, brings something as well. Maybe there is knowledge [about] syllokinetic plans that youâre bringing to the table.â Where things go from there is up to the players.
Studio Hermitage is hoping to spur on initial interest in Our Brilliant Ruin with a free set of rules for the fledgling tabletop game, which launches today alongside a Kickstarter campaign for a physical version. Next comes a series of comics to be produced in partnership with Dark Horse. After that comes a multi-part audio drama, to be written and produced by Wilkinson in the style of her previous effort, Vampire: The Masquerade - Port Saga. The team even plans to produce a video game.
They hope their transmedia companyâs vision will appeal to new audiences, especially those who havenât tried tabletop roleplaying before.
âI think this game is a beautiful blend of acknowledging the real world that weâre in, acknowledging the anxieties and acknowledging the trouble,â Wilkinson said, âbut also feeling a hunger for escapism, a way to take myself out of where I am in the real world and to be anything that I want to be.â
The campaign runs now through March 28.

Lofi Girl and Synthwave Boy just got new streams,"Lofi Girlâs world just keeps getting bigger and bigger. The YouTube channel known for the online radio stream âlofi hip hop radio â beats to relax/study toâ launched two new music streams on Monday. The first is âpeaceful piano radioâ starring Lofi Girl and the second is a âdark ambient radioâ stream featuring Synthwave Boy. 
More than 12,700 viewers tuned in to listen to the stream debuting Lofi Girlâs new piano tunes. Prior to its release, the official social media account for Lofi Girl and Synthwave Boy shared a video on Feb. 23 that showed the two putting on their shoes to go outside. On Monday, both characters disappeared from their rooms on their respective streams. Those streams continued to play the hip hop beats and synthwave music without the characters in frame, but it left fans pondering the whereabouts of the pair.
Later on Monday, the official X account announced two new streams. Lofi Girl has a new channel called âpeaceful piano radio â music to focus/study toâ where she sits in bed with her cat and continues to work, and Synthwave Boy has a stream called âdark ambient radio â music to escape/dream to.â Lofi Girlâs new feed shows her in two different scenes: one on a park bench and the other in bed while twinkling piano music plays. Meanwhile, Synthwave Boy also has a new animation showing him looking up into the night sky all alone as he listens to atmospheric music. 
This past week, we have been teasing at an exciting new launch!   Weâre super proud to introduce our 2 brand new radios to the lofi world:- peaceful piano radio   - music to focus/study to - featuring Lofi Girl- dark ambient radio  ï¸ - music to escape/dream to - featuringâ¦ pic.twitter.com/vY6ZGbnSEJ
Previously called âChilled Cow,â Lofi Girl is the name of both a YouTube channel and an animated character who stars in the channelâs 24-hour livestream of lo-fi hip-hop music. As the music plays, the video shows a looped animation of a girl quietly studying next to her cat. Over time, Lofi Girl has become a fixture of the internet. The YouTube channel has more than 13.9 million subscribers and has had promotional partnerships with major brands like Lego. 
This latest event is yet another example of how the lore and world around Lofi girl has grown over time. Initially, viewers only saw Lofi Girl in her room and that was it. However, in spring of 2023, Lofi Girl disappeared from her study and introduced us to a new character: a boy who listens to Synthwave with his dog. Since then, weâve gotten new tidbits on the character via different collaborations and projects tied to Lofi Girl.
Besides the new Synthwave Boy, weâve gotten other glimpses at the larger life and lore behind the character. In fall 2023, she left her room and we saw her star in a music video called âSnowman,â where we see her walk around the city alone and reminiscence about playing in the snow a a child. The creator behind the channel has also revealed details about her. According to an article translated from French via Google Translate, Lofi Girlâs name is Jade and she lives in Lyon, France. Sheâs also had special animations for promotional partnerships; at one point, she transformed into a Lego version of herself, and we also saw her play chess for Chess.com. 
Overall, Iâm just happy for Lofi Girl. It must have been so hard to listen to the same kind of music day-in and day-out for years. Now she gets to listen to a new variety for once.",https://www.polygon.com/24083817/lofi-girl-and-synthwave-boy-just-got-new-streams,2024-02-27 15:15:00
PokÃ©mon is getting a whole new way to collect cards virtually,"The PokÃ©mon Company and Creatures Inc. have revealed a new game dedicated to the collection of virtual trading cards. Itâs called PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket, and itâs a mobile game coming out sometime in 2024. Developers revealed the new title as part of the PokÃ©mon Presents stream on Tuesday. 
PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket is being developed by the PokÃ©mon Company, Creatures Inc., and DeNA, the developers of PokÃ©mon Masters EX. PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket will be released for iOS and Android mobile devices as a âfree-to-startâ app, a release said. 
According to the release, the developers aim to reimagine the experience of collecting PokÃ©mon cards with an âinnovative digital format.â The first look showed a snazzy animation on a phone screen as a person opened several packs of cards in the app. This game will also contain a new feature called âimmersive cards,â which are virtual collectibles that will allow players to explore the scenes shown in certain card art. To demonstrate this, the trailer showed a video of a person zooming in to look at details in a forest depicted in a Pikachu card. 
The game also appears to have ways to play with the cards you collect. It showed people trading cards and a new way to play the competitive TCG game. Yuji Kitano, president and CEO of Creatures Inc., said in the stream that Pocket will allow players to compete with ânew streamlined game rulesâ based on the existing battle system so players can do a quick battle during the day.

A new PokÃ©mon Legends game is coming to Switch in 2025,"The PokÃ©mon Company and Game Freak will release a new Legends game set in the franchiseâs Kalos region in 2025, the companies announced during Tuesdayâs PokÃ©mon Presents showcase. The new game, PokÃ©mon Legends Z-A, will be released on Nintendo Switch sometime next year.
PokÃ©mon Legends Z-Aâs reveal trailer was light on details, but the game will send players to Lumiose City â the Parisian-inspired central city of PokÃ©mon X and PokÃ©mon Y. The gameâs official reveal hints at an urban redevelopment plan for Lumiose City that will âshape the city into a place that belongs to both people and PokÃ©mon.â Beyond that, the trailer shows which PokÃ©mon players can expect to appear in PokÃ©mon Legends Z-A, but does not feature any gameplay.
The trailer does, however, hint at the return of Mega Evolutions, a mechanic introduced in PokÃ©mon X and PokÃ©mon Y.
Game Freak released PokÃ©mon Legends: Arceus in 2022. That spinoff game sent players to the past, to a version of the Sinnoh region when it was known as the Hisui region. Given PokÃ©mon Legends: Arceusâ historical setting, and the futuristic, almost Tron-like look of PokÃ©mon Legends Z-A, one has to wonder if players will be sent to the future for the next PokÃ©mon Legends game with all-new variations of PokÃ©mon from X and Y.",https://www.polygon.com/24084157/pokemon-z-a-legends-2025-trailer-nintendo-switch,2024-02-27 14:48:51
Everything announced during PokÃ©mon Day 2024âs PokÃ©mon Presents,"Itâs PokÃ©mon Day, the annual celebration of everything PokÃ©mon thatâs timed to the original launch of PokÃ©mon Red and PokÃ©mon Green in Japan on Feb. 27, 1996. The PokÃ©mon Company started celebrating the 1996 release date officially in 2016 and has hosted events every year since, making Feb. 27 one of the more important days on the PokÃ©mon fan calendar. Typically, we get a PokÃ©mon Presents broadcast on PokÃ©mon Day, and this year is no different: PokÃ©mon Presents debuted at 9 a.m. EST and showed off a whole new era of PokÃ©mon.
As usual, there were lots of smaller announcements and updates to PokÃ©monâs live service games like PokÃ©mon Unite and PokÃ©mon CafÃ© Mix, alongside news about other adaptations of the franchise. But PokÃ©mon Day, once again, did not disappoint with its big announcements, too.
Donât worry if you missed the broadcast â thereâs still time to celebrate. Hereâs everything announced during The PokÃ©mon Company 2024âs PokÃ©mon Presents.
PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A, developed by Game Freak, is pretty mysterious. The footage shown doesnât give a ton away on what to expect, except that itâs set in Lumiose City. The short clip kicked off with a document that teased the âurban redevelopment planâ for the city, which is from the Kalos region where PokÃ©mon X and PokÃ©mon Y games are set. We can glean some knowledge knowing itâs a PokÃ©mon Legends game, like PokÃ©mon Legends: Arceus, which took players into the past Sinnoh region.
Hereâs how The PokÃ©mon Company described the âambitiousâ game on its website.
A new adventure awaits within Lumiose City, where an urban redevelopment plan is underway to shape the city into a place that belongs to both people and PokÃ©mon. Please look forward to seeing it for yourself.ââ
The PokÃ©mon Company said itâll be released worldwide in 2025.
The PokÃ©mon Company is also debuting a new app thatâs all about collecting and trading PokÃ©mon cards. PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket lets you battle, too, but it looks like the core feature is swiping open lots of packs of PokÃ©mon cards. Youâll be able to open two packs per day for free, which signals that this app will have microtransactions.
Hereâs how The PokÃ©mon Company describes it:
In PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket, players will be able to enjoy the thrill of opening booster packs and collecting cards showcasing special visual effects unique to this digital adaptation of the PokÃ©mon TCG. PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket introduces âimmersive cards,â which give players the experience of leaping into the world of the cardâs illustration, providing a whole new way to enjoy the PokÃ©mon TCG. Players will be able to open two booster packs every day at no cost, including cards with nostalgic illustrations as well as new cards found only in the app. In addition, players will be able to engage in quick battles featuring streamlined rules based on the classic PokÃ©mon TCG battle system.
Creatures Inc. (which makes physical PokÃ©mon cards) is developing the game in collaboration with The PokÃ©mon Company. PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket is set to arrive in 2024.
Venusaur, Blastoise, and Charizard will all be featured in Tera Raid Battles for PokÃ©mon Scarlet and PokÃ©mon Violet.

"PlayStation laying off 900 people, closing London Studio entirely","Sony Interactive Entertainment is laying off around 900 workers, or 8% of the company, outgoing president and CEO Jim Ryan said in a news release published on Tuesday. Employees from all regions â North America; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; Japan; and Asia-Pacific â are impacted by the cuts, including several PlayStation development studios. London Studio, the in-house team that created the SingStar series, will close entirely, Ryan said. It was also revealed Naughty Dog, Insomniac Games, and Guerrilla Games will see layoffs.
âThese are incredibly talented people who have been part of our success, and we are very grateful for their contributions,â Ryan said in the news release. âHowever, the industry has changed immensely, and we need to future ready ourselves to set the business up for what lies ahead. We need to deliver on expectations from developers and gamers and continue to propel future technology in gaming, so we took a step back to ensure we are set up to continue bringing the best gaming experiences to the community.â

Impacted employees from the United States will be notified on Tuesday, Ryan said in an email to staff published on the Sony Interactive Entertainment website. United Kingdom labor laws require companies to enter a period of consultation before layoffs are made final; the London studio closure, layoffs at Firesprite Studio, and other redundancies are âproposedâ for now. Japanese employees will have access to a âa next career support program,â Ryan said.
Ryan said impacted employees will âreceive support, including severance benefits,â but did not elaborate further.
PlayStation Studiosâ London Studio was founded in 2002 as a first-party PlayStation developer; it developed gangster epic The Getaway, music game SingStar, and games for the PlayStation webcam like EyePet before moving on to virtual reality games for PlayStation VR. Firesprite was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2021; it also worked on virtual reality games, like Horizon Call of the Mountain, among other things.
âWhile these are challenging times, it is not indicative of a lack of strength of our company, our brand, or our industry,â Ryan said in the letter to staff. âOur goal is to remain agile and adaptable and to continue to focus on delivering the best gaming experiences possible now and in the future.â
The workplace cuts come shortly after Sonyâs recent financial report, wherein Sony chief operating officer and president Hiroki Totoki said that Sony Interactive Entertainment has no âmajor projectsâ due for release before March 2025. Totoki will take over as Sony Interactive Entertainmentâs interim CEO when Ryan leaves the PlayStation business in April. Speaking during the financial presentation, Totoki spoke about PlayStationâs first-party studios, saying thereâs âroom for improvementâ with how these studios spend money, schedule development, and stay accountable toward development pipelines.
The video game industry has been particularly volatile over the past several years. This has created an industry crisis, adding to the pressures of an already challenging profession. According to an industry tracker, more than 7,000 people have been laid off in 2024 alone â a number that is quickly approaching the more than 10,500 people laid off in 2023. 
Update (10:30 a.m. EDT): PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst posted an additional update that confirmed layoffs at Insomniac Games, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla Games, and in the Technology, Creative, and Support divisions.
Hulst said there are smaller cuts at other studios. He also confirmed that several games have been canceled, but did not say which ones. Hereâs his full message:
Today, Sony Interactive Entertainment initiated a reduction in our workforce â including within PlayStation Studios â and I wanted to talk about the impact that will have.  
These decisions have been extremely difficult, but they are necessary, and I think itâs important to be transparent:
The US based studios and groups impacted by a reduction in workforce are: 
- Insomniac Games, Naughty Dog, as well as our Technology, Creative, and Support teams
In UK and European based studios, it is proposed: 
- That PlayStation Studiosâ London Studio will close in its entirety;  
- That there will be reductions in Guerrilla and Firesprite 
These are in addition to some smaller reductions in other teams across PlayStation Studios. 
Our goal at PlayStation Studios has always been to make the best games for PlayStation fans, and our global community of studios represent some of the most creative and talented teams within the gaming industry.   
PlayStation 5 is in its fourth year, and we are at a stage where we need to step back and look at what our business needs.  
At the same time, our industry has experienced continuing and fundamental change which affects how we all create, and play, games. 
Delivering the immersive, narrative-driven stories that PlayStation Studios is known for, at the quality bar that we aspire to, requires a re-evaluation of how we operate. 
Delivering and sustaining social, online experiences â allowing PlayStation gamers to explore our worlds in different ways â as well as launching games on additional devices such as PC and Mobile, requires a different approach and different resources. 
To take on these challenges, PlayStation Studios had to grow. We have brought brilliant and successful Studios into our family. We have invested in new technology and partnerships. We have recruited talent from across our industry and beyond. 
But growth itself is not an ambition. PlayStation Studios is committed to continually discovering ways to work together; collaborating and combining our efforts to ensure that we are able to craft games that push the boundaries of play and deliver what you expect from us.  
We looked at our studios and our portfolio, evaluating projects in various stages of development, and have decided that some of those projects will not move forward. 
I want to be clear that the decision to stop work on these projects is not a reflection on the talent or passion of team members. 
Our philosophy has always been to allow creative experimentation. Sometimes, great ideas donât become great games. Sometimes, a project is started with the best intentions before shifts within the market or industry result in a change of plan. 
I am deeply saddened to see talented individuals leave the company. I have so much admiration, appreciation and respect for their work.  
PlayStation Studios will continue to be a creator-led organization driven by evolving our beloved franchises and bringing new gameplay experiences of the highest quality to our fans. 
Thank you all for your continued support.  ",https://www.polygon.com/24084509/playstation-layoff-900-workers-feb-2024,2024-02-27 14:10:51
Fortnite just got two new Lego games and you can play them right now,"The combined Lego and Fortnite universe is getting bigger â three times bigger, as of today. Lego Group and Epic Games announced two new Lego games, known as islands, will be coming to Fortnite. The first is a multiplayer problem-solving game with a pirate theme called Lego Raft Survival, and the second is a 3D platformer called Lego Obby Fun. Both games will be available to visit inside the Fortnite client starting Tuesday. 
Lego Raft Survival and Lego Obby Fun join a growing catalog of officially-licensed Lego games now resident inside Fortnite. These releases follow a $2 billion investment from Lego Group with Fortnite creator Epic Games in 2023 and the December release of Lego Fortnite, a crafting and survival game available inside the Fortnite client. Lego Group and Epic Games are calling this new style of licensed game an âisland.â So, for clarity, as of today there are now three distinct Lego-themed Fortnite games, aka islands: Lego Fortnite, Lego Raft Survival, and Lego Obby. 
Both new games will be compatible with the new Lego Fortnite character skins, currently available to wear only in Lego Fortnite. Weâve included the official descriptions of these new games, offered in todayâs news release, below: 
âLEGO Raft Survivalâ combines frenetic multiplayer problem solving with the classic LEGO Pirates theme, as the infamous Blackbeard challenges players and their friends to stay afloat on a raft in unfriendly waters! Players must survive on their raft against the cannon balls shot from the Barracuda Ship, collecting wood and treasures as resources and to build more rafts.
âLEGO Obby Funâ is the first official LEGO-themed obstacle course on Fortnite, that offers a LEGO-inspired take on climbing and problem solving through brick-built platforms designed by actual LEGO designers and packed with hot dogs, pizzas, unicorns and much more. 
Players are spawned randomly on a section of course inspired by popular LEGO themes (including LEGO Friends, LEGO City, LEGO NINJAGO and LEGO DREAMZzz) and the experience offers a different challenge each time to put their skills to the test, either solo or with friends.
Promotional screenshots for these games look adorable and lean into the playful and bright aesthetics of Lego childrenâs toys. You can find one very frantic Peely in the images of Lego Raft Survival below. 
Lego Obby Fun also looks gorgeous. Itâs a simple concept, but the obstacle courses that appear to have special themes are a visual delight. Once again, you can view more images below. 
The announcement solidifies Epic Gamesâ desire to transform Fortnite into a metaverse-style platform. Additionally, these new Lego games will directly compete for the younger audiences that are currently showing up on competing platforms like Roblox. Ironically, Roblox itself was for a time known informally as the Lego of games, not only because of its blocky graphics but because of the way it allowed kids to build their own activities inside the Roblox engine. âObby games,â short for obstacle course games, have long been a popular genre with younger players, both on Roblox and with fans of Minecraft. Now Fortnite has spun up an entire island dedicated to them with Lego Obby Fun. 
If you want to get even more granular about the weird relationship between Roblox and Fortnite, you can look at descriptions of these new Lego games. Todayâs news release formally called them âexperiences,â rather than just calling them video games. Thatâs a notable turn of phrase because Roblox leadership leaned into using the word after the Epic Games vs. Apple Computer trial, wherein Robloxâs leadership found need to distinguish its own user-generated content from the kind of content found inside Fortnite.
These three Lego Fortnite islands appear to be just the beginning. According to Mondayâs news release, the toy company will âlaunch several more Lego-themed experiences inside Fortnite throughout 2024 and beyond.â

Stardew Valleyâs anticipated 1.6 update coming in March,"Stardew Valleyâs hotly anticipated 1.6 patch finally has a release date: March 19, according to developer Eric âConcernedApeâ Barone. The game, which was originally released in 2016, has sold more than 30 million copies and is âthriving more than ever,â Barone posted to X, formerly Twitter, on Monday. And the new patch, which will bring lots of new content to the beloved life and farming simulator, will once again breathe new life into Stardew Valley at its eight anniversary.
The 1.6 patch will be released on March 19 for Windows PC players, and âas soon as possibleâ after for console and mobile. âWith a new update on the horizon, a worldwide concert tour underway, an official cookbook coming soon, and now over 30 million copies sold, Stardew Valley is thriving more than ever,â Barone said. âAs always, Iâm eternally grateful to the players (you! ) for making all of this possible.â
It's the 8th anniversary of Stardew Valley. Thank you for all the support over the years! Today I am announcing the PC Release date for the 1.6 update: --March 19th--. Console & Mobile will follow as soon as possible. pic.twitter.com/dMEFydjSqC
Last year, Barone gave a sneak peek at the update: Stardew Valley is expected to get a new major festival and two mini festivals, expanded late-game content, new items and crafting recipes, 100+ lines of dialogue, additional winter outfits for villagers, eight-player multiplayer support, a new farm type, and new secrets to discover. Barone has also previously said that Stardew Valleyâs 1.6 update will make the game easier and âmore powerfulâ to mod. He took a break in 2023 from his upcoming Haunted Chocolatier, which he started developing in 2020, to finalize the 1.6 update. Once itâs through the door, Barone expects to go back to Haunted Chocolatier, which heâs again developing on his own.
Stardew Valleyâs 1.5 patch was released in 2020 and was its biggest update since it was released in 2016. Then, Barone added an entirely new island to the game, as well as events, puzzles, a new farm, and plenty more. Itâs unclear how the 1.6 update compares with regards to scope, but with the release date announced, the hype is louder than ever.
Like Barone said, Stardew Valley is still as successful as ever. The orchestral concert tour is ongoing across the world, itâs got a board game adaptation, and a Stardew Valley cookbook coming this year.",https://www.polygon.com/24083974/stardew-valley-patch-1-6-release-date-march-19,2024-02-26 20:27:51

Welcome to Valley, the bucolic and vibrant home to the animalfolk of Bloomburrow, Magicâs first all-animal plane. Itâs a place where big adventures await even the smallest who are bold, inquisitive, and heroic, while those with more homespun and peaceable yearnings can enjoy the tranquil life.
But peace is endangered in Valley as the delicate balance of nature is threatened, and the elemental calamity beasts and the Great-Night Owl imperil the lives of its inhabitants. The animalfolk will have to band together to defend their homes. Led by Mabel, a mousefolk mother and reluctant hero, a party will strike out to investigate what has befallen a neighboring town. Along the way, theyâll be joined by a remarkable companion from a faraway land. In Bloomburrow, stouthearted heroes and overwhelming calamity beasts will come face to face in a struggle to restore the delicate balance of the land.
Bloomburrow previews kick off on July 9, before coming to a close on July 19. The digital release, via Magic: The Gathering - Arena, arrives on July 30 with physical release landing on Aug. 2 â just in time for this yearâs Gen Con in Indianapolis.

"Horizon, the Western epic Kevin Costner ditched Yellowstone to make with his own $100 million, gets a trailer","Kevin Costner could have phoned it in. Yellowstone, TV maven Taylor Sheridanâs neo-Western melodrama on Paramount Network, was riding high in the ratings going into 2023, and Costner had a strong platform in the leading role. But during negotiations for season 6, the 69-year-old actor walked away. He had other dreams: specifically, directing a four-part Western epic titled Horizon. Costner has blamed creative differences with Paramount and Sheridan over reported flaring tensions on the Yellowstone set, but ultimately, as he said in a recent divorce proceeding, he left over scheduling conflicts â with his own movie. (Next time you donât want to follow through on previously made plans, feel free to use this same excuse.)
Soon weâll see whether the risk and subsequent sensational Hollywood kerfuffle pays off; Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 both hit theaters this summer.
Like Dances with Wolves or Open Range, Horizon puts Costner back in the saddle as both director and star. The double featureâs first trailer promises more of his particular Western mode: sweeping vistas, raw depictions of the West, gunslinger shootouts, contemplations on the nature of man, and plenty of horses. But Costner hopes the breadth of his story will offer a new perspective on the American West. Or at least the American Western.  
âWe have a lot of Westerns that arenât good because they get too simplified, and Westerns are, in fact, complicated,â Costner said at a trailer launch event earlier this month. The filmmaker embraces the man-comes-to-town formula of the West â âwhen itâs done right, we never forget it, but too often, itâs just a convenience for a hero guy to knock down a dumb guy.â But he intends for Horizon to go deeper. âThis isnât Disneyland. These were real lives. People just making their way, women just trying to keep their families clean, fed â [they] basically worked to death. Womenâs lives were short, all they did was work. And so Iâm drawn to that. Iâm always gonna get to my gunfight â but Iâm drawn to the little things of what people had to endure.â
The trailer for Horizon is light on plot and heavy on the cast, which, according to previous reports, includes 170 speaking roles. Costner leads the pack as the classic Western cowboy type, with Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Michael Rooker, Tatanka Means, Sienna Miller, Danny Huston, Luke Wilson, and many more That Guys filling out the stable. Jamie Campbell Bower, who recently played Vecna on Stranger Things, loses the hellish makeup in favor of a 10-gallon hat as he plays the sagaâs villain. And what connects them all, from Indigenous peoples to longtime ranchers and a wave of newcomers to the West, is the fallout of the United Statesâ bloodiest conflict. 
âThe Civil War is a mark on our country,â Costner says. âHowever you choose to look at it, the loss of life, the reason it was fought [...] weâre still trying to come to terms with as a nation. But it closed the West in a blink of an eye. The Civil War actually kept the focus of the country on the East Coast, but the minute that war was over in 1865, the country looked West again, and in 25 years, something that had been there for thousands of years was over.
âOur national appetite was to be satisfied at the disadvantage to those who had been there and flourished and were living in their own way. And I donât know that Iâve ever come to terms with that myself. Iâd say Iâm ashamed of what happened... I donât know that Iâm ashamed or embarrassed, but I wanted to project what really happened. There was a great injustice that occurred in the West, but it doesnât minimize the courage it took for my ancestors to actually cut loose and go there. I recognize the resourcefulness, the bravery it took to leave and make this march across this country. Itâs just a movie that kind of shows the clash of cultures. Itâs our history.â 
The big goal for the Horizon movies was dimensionalizing all sides of the conflict, requiring him to produce a film that went far beyond the traditional scope of a two-hour Western. âI think itâs really a mistake sometimes to judge other people by how they had to perform or act in another century,â he says, emphasizing how the film weaves together stories of post-traumatic stress, the fortitude necessary to settle the West, and âthe fact native Indians were crushed under this movement.â 
Costnerâs grand thesis on Manifest Destiny has been percolating in his mind for ages. The actor-director originally wrote it under the title Sidewinder in 1988, and gave it the codename Horizon as he passed it around Hollywood, because he felt at the time, âpeople were copyingâ his developing projects, from Robin Hood to Wyatt Earp. (That includes his serious beef over 1993âs Tombstone.) Horizon started and stopped over the decades, with Disney almost producing the film, but Costner says he ultimately had to self-finance it to realize his sprawling vision. Reports circulated in 2023 that the actor had mortgaged real estate in order to pull together $100 million to shoot the first two chapters of Horizon. He verified that number for present press, saying it all went to shooting authentically on locations across Utah.
Not since Warner Bros. Pictures released two Matrix sequels within six months has a studio bucked the traditions of distribution in the way thatâs planned for Costnerâs saga. WB will once again be the risk-takers, distributing Chapter 1 on June 28 and Chapter 2 on Aug. 16. Whether we get Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 likely depends on whether Costner in his classic mode can draw Yellowstone crowds â and all of their friends, based on the price tag â to theaters. At the very least, he thinks heâs made two movies for the whole family. 
âI hope nobody is put off by the R [rating]. Because I donât make R [movies] gratuitously. I make Rs that a 12-year-old... If somebody says to them, âThis is going to be a little hard at a moment, but I want you to see it. I want my little girl to see what their great-great-great-grandmother went through.â I hope a family does go see it.â ",https://www.polygon.com/24083406/horizon-trailer-kevin-costner-release,2024-02-26 17:11:41
"On its third weekend, Helldivers 2 actually worked","It took just over two weeks and some loss of sleep, but Helldivers 2, the smash hit co-op shooter from PlayStation and Swedenâs Arrowhead Game Studio, now actually works. Which is to say, the game cruised through peak play hours over its third weekend with minimal login issues, and with the majority of players able to get online and work together to save managed democracy, eliminating one bug (or robot) at a time.
Thatâs according to Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt (and also according to Polygonâs own anecdotal experience â we had no issues playing over the weekend).
âIâm really happy and proud of the Arrowhead team for an amazing Achievement, the servers handled all Helldivers 2 players this weekend without problem,â Pilestedt posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday morning. âNow we have time to focus on improvements to the title and resume our original plan. Many exciting things upcoming!â

    Related
  
Going in to the weekend, Pilestedt had been bullish that his team had finally managed to increase the gameâs server capacity enough to meet player demand. On Friday he said that the team had boosted capacity to 700,000 concurrent players, and while he expected that limit to be reached, he thought wait times would be âbearable.â On Saturday, he said the capacity had been raised to 800,000 players with âlight queues to get in at peak.â
âHow crazy is this message from a studio of ~100 devs?â Pilestedt asked rhetorically, finally allowing himself a humblebrag about how big Helldivers 2 had gotten despite the relatively modest size of the studio that made it.
With a peak of over 450,000 concurrent players on Steam, Helldivers 2 has now made a home for itself in the top five games on the platform, ahead of Apex Legends. Presumably its audience on PlayStation 5 doesnât lag too far behind, although Sony doesnât share this data.
But perhaps the most remarkable part of this success story is how Arrowhead has weathered some debilitating tech issues without losing the goodwill of the majority of players. Thatâs partly attributable to how much fun the game is, and partly due to Arrowheadâs underdog status (despite being underwritten by Sony). But itâs also down to Pilestedt tweeting through it with total candor, good humor, and an invitation to players to empathize with the hard-pressed developers. Sonyâs campaign to get into live service games is off to the best possible start, and Pilestedt can take a lot of credit for that.

"A Game of Thrones movie trilogy was blocked by HBO, say showrunners","We may keep hearing new details about why the ending of HBOâs Game of Thrones was disappointing forever â or at least as long as the showâs creators, David Benioff, and D.B. Weiss are still working. In an interview with WSJ. Magazine while promoting their new series, Netflixâs 3 Body Problem, the two mentioned they wanted to finish Game of Thrones off with a series of movies, but HBO and AT&T had other ideas. Much, much worse ideas.
The showrunning duo said they wanted to finish off the last two seasons of Game of Thrones as three movies, instead of the 13 total episodes we ended up with. While this might not have fixed many fansâ complaints of a rushed ending, it seems HBO had a different reason for nixing the idea: its name. According to Benioff and Weiss, the executive team reminded them that they were making shows for the âHome Box Officeâ not the âAway Box Office.â 
But while this juicy bit of information is yet another fascinating insight into the very strange ending of HBOâs biggest series, it isnât even the most baffling and dispiriting reveal in the interview. 
That honor belongs to the person who apparently suggested Benioff and Weiss film Game of Thrones vertically, so it would be easier to watch on phones. The comment came from an executive at AT&T, the then parent company of Warner Bros., which owns HBO. The company also reportedly discussed creating mini-episodes of the show that would be more âsnackableâ â  so shorter and easier to watch for mobile viewers. 
Most recent discussions of Warner Bros. and HBO have revolved around the decisions made by David Zaslav, who took over as CEO after the company merged with Discovery in 2022. Since then, Zaslav has radically cut down on the companyâs emphasis on the Max streaming platform (which he oversaw the renaming of) and increased its focus on theatrical distribution and reality show content. More controversially, the company has also decided to shelve several movies, like Batgirl, Salemâs Lot, and Coyote vs Acme, while selling streaming rights for other movies to competitors like Netflix. 
But all this dredging up of ridiculous meetings and requests by Benioff and Weiss is a pretty good reminder that Warner Bros. management has made questionable decisions for a long time. Considering moving HBOâs flagship show into a mobile-friendly format or making bite-sized episodes may sound ridiculous, but it makes sense when you have a phone company trying to get the most out of its struggling entertainment branch. Exactly why AT&T would assume its customers couldnât rotate their phones is a different, more difficult question. 
Even if the studio now known as Warner Bros. Discovery is still on shaky ground, with shelved movies and a Friday stock market downturn after its earnings report, at least its current emphasis is on major franchises and theatrical releases, instead of vertical video.

All the Arcane season 2 news weâve heard so far,"League of Legendsâ animated Netflix show, Arcane, is coming back for season 2, and while thereâs a trailer out and a release window, other details on the showâs return are pretty sparse. 
Hereâs everything we know about Arcane season 2 so far, including whoâs animating it, when itâs coming out, and which champions may, or may not, be showing up next season based on the teasers we have so far. 
Arcane season 2 is set for release in November of this year. We donât know exactly when in November though, since the release month is all Netflix has revealed so far. Perhaps even more importantly, we donât know exactly how Arcane season 2 will be released. The first time around, Netflix eschewed its usual batch-release model in favor of releasing the series a few episodes at a time. Itâs unclear if the streamer will do that again, release them all at once, or maybe even opt for a one-episode-a-week schedule this time around. 
While we donât know exactly what the new season of the show will center on, weâre pretty confident that it will continue the stories of each of the main characters from season 1. Vi, Caitlyn, Jinx, Ekko, Viktor, and Jayce all seem like theyâll have a role to play in the new season. There are also a few hints that the series could bring back other characters in some pretty tragic ways, but weâll have to wait for the season to arrive or for more information to know for sure. 
Warwick seems almost guaranteed, and a more recognizable version of Singed is certainly on the way as well, since both seem to show up in the second seasonâs first teaser trailer. With the introduction of Noxus to the story itâs also possible we could see champions like Darius, and thereâs a good chance we could see Demacia as well. Of course, there are also quite a few more Piltover champions who could make an appearance like Ezreal or even Blitzcrank. But itâs really all just speculation at this point. 
Yes, Fortiche is back to do the second season of Arcane, and thatâs part of why it took so long. The small studioâs quality work takes quite a bit of time, and Riot gave them all the time it needed to finish season 2. 
Well, yes and no. Everything in the show is more or less accurate to the games, as far as settings, locations, and characters are concerned. But Arcane is building its storyline more or less from scratch since League of Legends doesnât offer much in the story department. So if youâre hoping to look to the game for an accurate preview of whatâs to come, youâre probably going to be pretty disappointed. 
No, probably not. I mean, many people do play it, and itâs objectively a great game. But if you donât play it at this point, thatâs probably healthier for your life and relationships overall. Plus, because there isnât any story Arcane will be adapting, you likely wonât learn anything new.",https://www.polygon.com/24081168/arcane-season-2-release-date-cast-news-league-legends-netflix,2024-02-23 20:45:06
Believe it! A live-action Naruto is on the way from the director of Shang-Chi,"Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, American Born Chinese) will write and direct Lionsgateâs long-gestating live-action movie based on Masashi Kishimotoâs Naruto. 
In Naruto, Kishimoto combined a ruthless refinement of shonen mangaâs themes of perseverance and drama with the kid-irresistible story of the class clown at a school for ninjas, creating an internationally beloved hit manga and subsequent anime adaptations. Lionsgate announced it was in development of a live-action movie a year after the mangaâs 2014 conclusion, but with little movement on the project in the decade since. 
Boasting writer and director credits on most of his projects, Cretton has already demonstrated a deft hand with both action directing and molding adaptations, and that work seems to have won an enthusiastic approval from Kishimoto. According to a statement given to The Hollywood Reporter, the mangaka learned of Crettinâs involvement right after watching âa blockbuster action film of his,â and thought he would be a perfect fit for Naruto. 
âAfter enjoying his other films and understanding that his forte is in creating solid dramas about people,â said Kishimoto, âI became convinced that there is no other director for Naturo. In actually meeting Destin, I also found him to be an open-minded director who was willing to embrace my input, and felt strongly that we would be able to cooperate together in the production process.â 
That âblockbuster action film of hisâ is almost certainly the MCUâs Shang-Chi, and Cretton is currently filming a Wonder Man TV series for Marvel Studios, with a Shang-Chi sequel somewhere on the horizon. Itâs not clear how the Naruto film will fit into that schedule â but itâs safe to say that you have several years to work on your opening night cosplay.

Seems like that Age of Empires mobile game is actually happening,"Age of Empires fans know that getting a version of the game on mobile has been a long struggle. However, a new contender is set to be released soon. Worldâs Edge has unveiled new details for the upcoming Age of Empires Mobile at its âNew Year, New Ageâ event on Friday, and the game looks to contain most of what youâd get in the regular console or PC version.
The free-to-play game is being developed by Tencent-owned TiMi Studio Group, which worked on Call of Duty Mobile with Activision, along with the studio Worldâs Edge, which is owned by Xbox. Age of Empires Mobile is now available for pre-registration on iOS and Android globally. Thereâs no word on a release date yet (although the iOS page says itâs expected on Aug. 19) but itâs expected to launch later in 2024.
The announcement claims that Age of Empires Mobile will replicate a lot of the gameplay with which fans are familiar, like fast-paced combat, real-time strategy, base-building, and online PvP multiplayer, but with controls that are optimized for mobile devices, Players will be able to make teams with a number of famous leaders from history and across the Age of Empires franchise, like Julius Caesar, King Arthur, Hannibal, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, and more. Developers promise players will be able to battle it out with tons of other people online â just like they would in the regular versions (although they can also play solo).
âWe grew up playing Age of Empires on our PCs and believe we can offer a new but similarly exciting experience for mobile players,â Brayden Fan, a general manager for TiMi, said in a press release. 
This isnât the first time Microsoft has tried to release a mobile version of the game. Back in June 2013, Microsoft was trying its hand at mobile game development, with one of its first projects being an Age of Empires mobile game. The IP was licensed out to KLabGames, which would develop a free-to-play version for iOS and Android (and later for Windows Phone, if you really want to date the announcement). This turned into Age of Empires: World Domination, which was released in December 2015, but got shut down in November 2016 â  so it didnât even last a year. 
Microsoft had also tried a couple of times to make a free-to-play version of Age of Empires. First, there was Age of Empires Online, an MMO real-time strategy game that was released in 2011. It was free to download but featured premium content that wasnât fairly priced. This, combined with the lack of content available in general, made the game unsustainable. Microsoft Studios executive producer Kevin Perry said at a GDC talk in 2013 that it was âan okay game but with a bad free-to-play business model,â so it didnât last long either. There was also Age of Empires: Castle Siege from 2014, which was a tower defense game developed specifically for touchscreens on Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone, although it came to Android and iOS later. It was also free-to-play with microtransactions. That one lasted a little longer than the others, but it was still shut down in 2019.
There is currently a China-only mobile game out on Android called Return to Empire, which was also developed by TiMi Studio. Age of Empires Mobile will be similar to the Chinese version, but in a statement to Polygon, Fan said that these are different games for different audiences, and that the newer title will have Worldâs Edgeâs direct involvement; Return to Empire does not. 
âAge of Empires Mobile will offer new concepts and designs, including more narrative, single-player content, more elements from the original Age of Empires franchise, an improved new player experience, and considerable differences in its core gameplay that we anticipate will keep global players engaged for a long time to come,â he said. âWe also will be creating bespoke in-game activities and events for players so they feel like the game is a good fit for their local playstyles and preferences.â
Microsoftâs mobile strategy lately has been focused on making cloud gaming viable on smartphones and tablets. However, with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft can now use the resources from King (developers of Candy Crush Saga), ZeniMax, and other studios to bolster that end of its portfolio. So with new resources, a long history of free-to-play failures, and the involvement of a studio with mobile development successes, maybe Age of Empires Mobile will stick this time.

Nightingale devs to add offline mode after negative player feedback,"Nightingale is off to a good start. The horror-tinged, multiplayer survival and crafting game entered early access this week on Steam, and so far has peaked at over 32,000 players. However, like many online games, itâs had a rough first week. One of the most common complaints from users (among the usual early access fare like the lack of some quality-of-life features), according to Steam forums, is the âalways onlineâ requirement, which requires even solo players to join a server. 
The developers at Inflexion Games have noticed though, and are working on some changes. In a blog posted on the Nightingale website on Thursday, the team announced that it would be focusing on implementing an offline mode sooner than expected.
âWe are now prioritizing and developing an offline mode that we plan to release as soon as feasible,â the announcement read. In an update to the post and on the official Discord, it was reiterated that the change in direction doesnât mean other updates would be ignored. âThe offline mode development does not mean weâre stopping or de-prioritizing regular feature development, updates, QoL updates, and bug fixes,â community manager Steph H wrote on Discord. 
The post explains the original reasoning behind making Nightingale online only. Essentially, the developers envisioned a game that was a series of interconnected Realms â i.e., the different instances where players can explore in the game â  that users could share with others. So you can share a Realm with a friend in your party, and they can explore it on their own without needing you there to host it. There are also cards that allow you to apply effects to certain Realms, so their being separate has some in-game uses, too. Overall, itâs a unique way to do an open-world survival game. 
It also meant that the team had to focus on either implementing their version of co-op or working on offline mode for the early access release.
âCo-operative gameplay associated with having party members across multiple Realms was the more technically challenging problem and therefore the one we chose to tackle first,â the post says. Considering the feedback, though, the developers say they âmisjudged what some of you were looking for in your experience.â
Itâs unclear on the timeline for this feature addition, but itâll be a welcome one. Not only have solo players been experiencing server and networking errors that seem unnecessary, but also there are bad optics with a game being online only since not everybody has stable internet with high speeds.

"Baldurâs Gate 3 will get official mod support, says Larian Studios","After a recent Baldurâs Gate 3 hotfix broke a lot of mods, including a popular tool, Larian Studios announced that itâs working on official mod support.  
Larianâs director of publishing Michael Douse took to X (formerly Twitter) to address some concerns from the modding community, stating that the team was working on cross-platform mod support. The update is expected to be released later this year.
We generally donât talk about things til theyâre ready, but as you may have read, weâre making an exception. Weâve been working on a robust, cross-platform plan for mod support to be released later in year. We love our modding community and we want to support them. Itâs coming. https://t.co/54GsxNshlQ
âWe have a system but it needs to be tested and still requires work,â he wrote. âI understand that it suckâs [sic] when the game is updated and mods break. Our community teams will start talking with and looping in modding community. For now, work continues.â
The Baldurâs Gate 3 modding community has been dealing with a lack of support even before the game left early access. Itâs tough for modders to constantly have to update or work around the problems that hotfixes and patches can create. For example, hotfix #18 broke Baldurâs Gate 3 Script Extender, which is a popular tool used by modders and people who use mods â and this isnât the first time the tool has broken, either. There are so many mods for the game, including some that just add quality-of-life features (like increasing or decreasing in-game notifications), along with some that let players customize the charactersâ appearances.
According to WombatMedic, a senior community strategist in the official Larian Studios Discord, developers have been working on this for a while. Itâll be a long process, however, with Wombat saying that players should expect it to come with the next big patch, which is âseveral months away.â (For reference, the last big patch came out last week.)
âWe absolutely love that we have such an active modding community across our titles [...] We want to continue making sure youâre getting the best possible experience, which is why we frequently patch the game, although this does inevitably mean that each new patch or hotfix has the potential to become incompatible with your favourite mods,â she wrote. âWe know this sucks, we know you want to play with mods, and we want to make this right.â
Wombat responded to user concerns in the Discord that the team also needed to do a better job communicating resources and support. 
âTogether with the platform holders, we are working on making this a reality, and are forming a team to support mod curation. Weâre aiming to offer modding support for things like classes, UI, customisation, spells, and certain assets and game mechanics,â she wrote.
